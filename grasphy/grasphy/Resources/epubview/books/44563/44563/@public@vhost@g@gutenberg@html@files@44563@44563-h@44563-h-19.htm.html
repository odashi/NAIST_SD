you do not agree to abide by all<br/>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy<br/>all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.<br/>If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the<br/>terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person

in the United States.  If an<br/>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are<br/>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from<br/>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative<br/>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg<br/>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by<br/>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of<br/>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with<br/>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by<br/>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.<br/><br/>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern<br/>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in<br/>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check<br/>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement<br/>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or<br/>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations

identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread<br/>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic<br/>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain<br/>"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or<br/>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual<br/>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a<br/>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by<br/>your

middle-aged and new computers.  It exists<br/>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from<br/>people in all walks of life.<br/><br/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the<br/>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's<br/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will<br/>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure<br/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.<br/>To
