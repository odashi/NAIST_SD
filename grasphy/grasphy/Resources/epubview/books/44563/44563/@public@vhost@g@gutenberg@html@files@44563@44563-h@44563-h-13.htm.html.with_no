<span id="SENTENCE_16">One of Mr. FitzAdam's correspondents is describing a morning he spent in the library of Lord Finican, with which nobleman he was invited to breakfast:—</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_17">'I now fell to the books with a good appetite, intending to make a full meal; and while I was chewing upon a piece of Tully's philosophical writings, my lord came in upon me.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_18">His looks discovered great uneasiness, which I attributed to the effects of the last night's diversions; but good manners requiring me to prefer his lordship's conversation to my own amusement, I replaced his book, and by the sudden satisfaction in his countenance perceived that the cause of his perturbation was my holding open the book with a pinch of snuff in my fingers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_19">He said he was glad to see me, for he should not have known else what to have done with himself.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_20">I returned the compliment by saying I</span>
<a id="Page_335" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="335">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_21">thought he could not want entertainment amidst so choice a collection of books.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_22">"Yes," replied he, "the collection is not without elegance; but I read men only now, for I finished my studies when I set out on my travels.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_23">You are not the first who has admired my library; and I am allowed to have as fine a taste in books as any man in England."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_24">'Hereupon he showed me a "Pastor Fido," bound in green and decorated with myrtle-leaves.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_25">He then took down a volume of Tillotson, in a black binding, with the leaves as white as a law-book, and gilt on the back with little mitres and crosiers; and lastly, Cæsar's "Commentaries," clothed in red and gold, in imitation of the military uniform of English officers.'</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_31">Mr. FitzAdam prints a letter received from a widow, describing the real facts of the injuries by which her husband had lost his life in a duel:—</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_32">'Mr. Muzzy was very fat and extremely lethargic, and so stupidly heavy that he fell asleep even in musical assemblies, and snored in the playhouse, as loud, poor man! as he used to snore in bed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_33">However, having received many taunts and reproaches, he resolved to challenge his own cousin-german, Brigadier Truncheon, of Soho Square.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_34">It seems the person challenged</span>
<a id="Page_336" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="336">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_35">fixed upon the place and weapons.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_36">Truncheon, a deep-sighted man, chose Primrose Hill for the field of battle, and swords for the weapons of defence.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_37">To avoid suspicion and to prevent a discovery, they were to walk together from Piccadilly, where we then lived, to the summit of Primrose Hill.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_38">Truncheon's scheme took effect.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_39">Mr. Muzzy was much fatigued and out of breath with the walk.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_40">However, he drew his sword; and, as he assured me himself, began to attack his cousin with valour.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_41">The brigadier went back; Mr. Muzzy pursued; but not having his adversary's alacrity, he stopped a little to take breath.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_42">He stopped, alas! too long: his lethargy came on with more than usual violence; he first dozed as he stood upon his legs, and then beginning to nod forward, dropped by degrees upon his face in a most profound sleep.</span>
</p>

</div>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_43">'Truncheon, base man! took this opportunity to wound my husband as he lay snoring on the ground; and he had the cunning to direct his stab in such a manner as to make it supposed that Mr. Muzzy had fled, and in his flight had received a wound in the most ignominious part of his body.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_44">You will ask what became of the seconds.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_45">They were both killed upon the spot; but being only two servants, the one a butler and the other a cook, they were buried the same night; and by the power of a little money, properly applied, no further inquiry was made about them.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_46">'Mr. Muzzy, wounded as he was, might probably have slept upon that spot for many hours, had he not been awakened by the cruel bites of a mastiff.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_47">My poor husband was thoroughly awakened by the new hurt he had received; and indeed it was impossible to have slept while he was losing whole collops of the fattest and most pulpy part of his flesh: so that he was brought home to me much more wounded by the teeth of the mastiff than</span>
<a id="Page_337" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="337">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_48">by the sword of his cousin Truncheon.'</span>

</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_103">'And as it requires more pains to extirpate some weeds than others, according as they are more firmly fixed, more numerous, or more naturalised to the soil; so those faults will be found to be most difficult to be suppressed which have been of the largest growth and taken the deepest root, which are more predominant in number and most congenial to the constitution.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_170">I doubt, Mr. FitzAdam, you will hardly forbear smiling to hear a man who was almost starved talk gravely of compiling observations on diet.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_171">The moment I finished my volume I ran to an eminent bookseller near the Mansion House; he was just set down to dinner....</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_172">As soon as the cloth was taken away I produced my manuscript, and the bookseller put on his spectacles; but to my no small mortification, after glancing an eye over the title-page, he looked steadfastly upon me for near a minute in a kind of amazement I could not account for, and then broke out in the following manner:—"My dear sir, you are come to the very worst place in the world for the sale of such a</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_218">Horace tells us that a sharp nose was an indication of satirical wit and humour; for when speaking of his friend Virgil, though he says, "At est bonus, ut melior non alius quisquam," yet he allows he was no joker, and not a fit match at the sneer for those of his companions who had sharper noses than his own.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_219">They also looked upon the short noses, with a little inflection at the end tending upwards, as a mark of the owner's being addicted to jibing; for the same author, talking of Mæcenas, says that though he was born of an ancient family, yet was he not apt to turn persons of low birth into ridicule, which he expresses by saying that "he had not a turn-up nose."</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_316">'I thought it a little hard, indeed, that a man should be taxed for having one creature in his house in which he might confide; but when I heard that officers were to be appointed to knock out the brains of all these honest domestics who should presume to make their appearance in the streets without the passport of their master's name about their necks, I became seriously concerned for them.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_317">'This enmity against dogs is pretended upon the apprehension of their going mad; but an easier remedy might be applied, by abolishing the custom (with many others equally ingenious) of stringing bottles and stones to their tails, by which means (and in this one particular I must give up my clients) the unfortunate sufferer becomes subject to the persecutions of his own species, too apt to join the run against a brother in distress.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_323">'Mr. FitzAdam,—Walking up St. James's Street the other day, I was stopt by a very smart young female, who begged my pardon for her boldness, and, looking very innocently in my face, asked me if I did not know her.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_324">The manner of her accosting me and the extreme prettiness of her figure made me look at her with attention; and I soon recollected that she had been a servant-girl of my wife's, who had taken her from the country, and, after keeping her three years in her service, had dismissed her about two months ago.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_325">"What, Nanny," said I, "is it you?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_326">I never saw anybody so fine in all my life!"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_327">"Oh, sir!" says she, with the most innocent smile imaginable, bridling her head and curtsying down to the ground, "I have been led astray since I lived with my mistress."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_328">"Have you so, Mrs. Nanny?" said I; "and pray, child, who is it that has led you astray?"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_329">"Oh,</span>
<a id="Page_354" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="354">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_330">sir!" says she, "one of the worthiest gentlemen in the world; and he has bought me a new négligée for every day in the week."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_331">'The girl pressed me to go and look at her lodgings, which she assured me were hard by in Bury Street, and as fine as a duchess's; but I declined her offer, knowing that any arguments of mine in favour of virtue and stuff gowns would avail but little against pleasure and silk négligées.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_332">I therefore contented myself with expressing my concern for the way of life she had entered into, and bade her farewell.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_333">'Being a man inclined to speculate a little, as often as I think of the finery of this girl, and the reason alleged for it, I cannot help fancying, whenever I fall in company with a pretty woman, dressed out beyond her visible circumstances, patched, painted, and ornamented to the extent of the mode, that she is going to make me her best curtsy, and to tell me, "Oh, sir!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_334">I have been led astray since I kept good company."'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_372">The Last of Mr. FitzAdam.</span>
</i>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_373">'Before these lines can reach the press, that truly great and amiable gentleman, Mr. FitzAdam, will, in all probability, be no more.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_374">An event so sudden and unexpected, and in which the public are so deeply interested, cannot fail to excite the curiosity of every reader.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_375">I shall, therefore, relate it in the most concise manner I am able.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_376">'The reader may remember that in the first number of the "World," and in several succeeding papers, the good old gentleman flattered himself that the profits of his labours would some time or other enable him to make a genteel figure in the world, and seat himself at last in his</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_377">one-horse chair</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_378">.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_379">The death of Mrs. FitzAdam, which happened a few months since, as it relieved him from the great expense of housekeeping, made him in a hurry to set up his equipage; and as the sale of his paper was even beyond his expectations, I was one of the first of his friends that advised him to purchase it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_380">The equipage was accordingly bespoke and sent home; and as he had all along promised that his first visit in it should be to me, I expected him last Tuesday at my country-house at Hoxton.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_381">The poor gentleman was punctual to his appointment; and it was with great delight that I saw him from my window driving up the road that leads to my house.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_382">Unfortunately for him, his eye caught mine; and hoping (as I suppose) to captivate me by his great skill in driving, he made two or three flourishes with his whip, which so frightened the horse that he ran furiously away with the carriage, dashed it against a post, and threw the driver from his seat with a violence hardly to be conceived.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_383">I screamed out to my maid, "Lord bless me!" says I, "Mr. FitzAdam is killed!" and away we ran to the spot where he lay.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_384">At first I imagined that his head was off, but upon drawing nearer I found it was his hat!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_385">He breathed, indeed, which gave me hopes that he was not quite dead; but for signs of life, he had positively none.</span>
