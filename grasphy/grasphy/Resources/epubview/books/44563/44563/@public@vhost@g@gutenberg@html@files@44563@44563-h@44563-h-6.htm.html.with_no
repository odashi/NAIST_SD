<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_2">'It has been customary, of late years, for the purveyors of amusing literature—the popular authors of the day—to put forth</span>
<a id="Page_168" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="168">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_3">certain opuscles, denominated "Christmas Books," with the ostensible intention of swelling the tide of exhilaration, or other expansive emotions, incident upon the exodus of the old and the inauguration of the new year.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_4">We have said that their ostensible intention was such, because there is another motive for these productions, locked up (as the popular author deems) in his own breast, but which betrays itself, in the quality of the work, as his principal incentive.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_5">Oh! that any muse should be set upon a high stool to cast up accounts and balance a ledger!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_6">Yet so it is; and the popular author finds it convenient to fill up the declared deficit and place himself in a position the more effectually to encounter those liabilities which sternly assert themselves contemporaneously and in contrast with the careless and free-handed tendencies of the season by the emission of Christmas books—a kind of literary</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_7">assignats</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_8">, representing to the emitter expunged debts, to the receiver an investment of enigmatical value.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_9">For the most part bearing the stamp of their origin in the vacuity of the writer's exchequer rather than in the fulness of his genius, they suggest by</span>
<a id="Page_169" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="169">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_10">their feeble flavour the rinsings of a void brain after the more important concoctions of the expired year.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_11">Indeed, we should as little think of taking these compositions as examples of the merits of their authors as we should think of measuring the valuable services of Mr. Walker the postman, or Mr. Bell the dust-collector, by the copy of verses they leave at our doors as a provocative of the expected annual gratuity—effusions with which they may fairly be classed for their intrinsic worth no less than their ultimate purport.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_12">Too much for his horse</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_13">Upon this, and upon some little peculiarities of style in the review, such as a passage in which the learned critic compared the author's satirical attempts to 'the sardonic divings after the pearl of truth whose lustre is eclipsed in the display of the diseased oyster,' Thackeray replied in the preface to a second edition of the little book, published a few days later, and entitled an 'Essay on Thunder and Small Beer.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_14">The style of the 'Times' critique, which was generally attributed to Samuel Phillips,</span>
<a id="Page_170" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="170">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_15">afforded too tempting a subject for the satirical pen of the author of 'Vanity Fair,' to be passed over.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_16">The easy humour with which he exposes the pompous affectation of superiority in his critic, the tawdry sentences and droll logic of his censor, whom he likened not to the awful thunderer of Printing House Square, but to the thunderer's man, 'Jupiter Jeames, trying to dazzle and roar like his awful employer,' afforded the town, through the newspapers which copied the essay, an amount of amusement not often derived from an author's defence of himself from adverse criticism.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_17">The essay was remembered long after, when work after work of the offending author was severely handled in the same paper; and the recollection of it gave a shadow of support to the theory by which some persons, on the occasion of Thackeray's death, endeavoured to explain the fact that the obituary notice in the 'Times,' and the account of his funeral, were more curt than those of any other journal; while the 'Times' alone, of all the daily papers, omitted to insert a leading article on the subject of the great loss which had been sustained by the world of letters.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_18">CHAPTER IX.</span>
</h2>
<p class="ch_summ">
<span id="SENTENCE_19">Commencement of the Series of Early Essayists—Thackeray as a Lecturer—The 'English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century'—Charlotte Brontë at Thackeray's readings—The Lectures repeated in Edinburgh—An invitation to visit America—Transatlantic popularity—Special success attending the reception of the 'English Humourists' in the States—'Week-day Preachers'—Enthusiastic Farewell—Appleton's New York edition of Thackeray's works; the Author's introduction, and remarks on International Copyright—Thackeray's departure—Cordial impression bequeathed to America—The 'History of Henry Esmond, a story of Queen Anne's Reign'—The writers of the Augustan Era—The 'Newcomes'—An allusion to George Washington misunderstood—A second visit to America—Lectures on the 'Four Georges'—The series repeated at home—Scotch sympathy—Thackeray proposed as a candidate to represent Oxford in Parliament—His liberal views and impartiality.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_20">In 1851 Thackeray appeared in an entirely new character, but one which subsequently proved so lucrative to him, that to this cause, even more than to the labours of his pen, must be attributed that easy fortune which he had accumulated before he died.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_21">In May he commenced the delivery of a series of lectures on the English Humourists.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_22">The subjects were—Swift, Congreve and Addison; Steele; Prior, Gay and Pope; Hogarth, Smollett and Fielding, and Sterne and Goldsmith.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_23">The lectures were delivered at Willis's Rooms.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_24">The price of admission was high, and the audience was numerous, and of the most select kind.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_25">It was not composed of that sort of people who crowd to pick up information in the shape of facts with which they have been previously unacquainted, but those who, knowing the eminence of the lecturer, wished to hear his opinion on a subject of national interest.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_26">One of the two great humourists of the present age was about to utter his sentiments on the humourists of the age now terminated, and the occasion was sufficient to create an interest</span>
<a id="Page_172" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="172">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_27">which not even the attractive power of the Great Exhibition, then open, could check.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_28">The newspapers complained slightly of the low key in which the lecturer spoke, from which cause many of his best points were sometimes lost to the more distant of his auditors.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_29">'In other respects,' says a newspaper report, 'we cannot too highly praise the style of his delivery.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_30">Abstaining from rant and gesticulation he relied for his effect on the matter which he uttered, and it was singular to see how the isolated pictures by a few magic touches descended into the hearts of his hearers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_31">Among the most conspicuous of the literary ladies at this gathering was Miss Brontë, the authoress of 'Jane Eyre.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_32">She had never before seen the author of 'Vanity Fair,' though she had dedicated the second edition of her own celebrated novel to him, with the assurance that she regarded him 'as the social regenerator of his day—as the very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped state of things.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_33">Mrs. Gaskell tells us that, when the lecture was over, the lecturer descended from the platform, and making his way towards her, frankly asked her for her opinion.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_34">'This,' adds Miss Brontë's biographer, 'she mentioned to me not many days afterwards, adding remarks almost identical with those which I subsequently read in "Villette," where a similar action on the part of M. Paul Emanuel is related.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_35">The remarks of this singular woman upon Thackeray and his writings, and her accounts of her interviews with him, are curious, and will be found scattered through Mrs. Gaskell's popular biography.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_36">Readers of the 'Cornhill Magazine' will not have forgotten Thackeray's affectionate and discriminating sketch of her, which appeared some years later in that periodical.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_37">The course was perfectly successful, and the Lectures, subsequently reprinted, rank among the most masterly of his writings.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_38">They were delivered again soon afterwards in some of the provincial cities, including Edinburgh.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_39">A droll anecdote was related at this period in the newspapers, in connection with one of these provincial appearances.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_40">Previously to delivering them in Scotland, the lecturer bethought himself of addressing them to the rising youth of our two great nurseries of the national mind; and it was necessary, before appearing at Oxford, to obtain the licence of the authorities—a very laudable arrangement, of course.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_41">The Duke of Wellington was the Chancellor, who, if applied to, would doubtless</span>
<a id="Page_173" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="173">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_42">have understood at once the man and his business.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_43">The Duke lived in the broad atmosphere of the every-day world, and a copy of 'Vanity Fair' was on a snug shelf at Walmer Castle.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_44">But his deputy at Oxford, on whom the modest applicant waited, knew less about such trifles as 'Vanity Fair' and 'Pendennis.' 'Pray what can I do to serve you, sir?' enquired the bland functionary.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_45">'My name is Thackeray.' 'So I see by this card.' 'I seek permission to lecture within the precincts.' 'Ah! you are a lecturer; what subjects do you undertake—religious or political?' 'Neither; I am a literary man.' 'Have you written anything?' 'Yes; I am the author of "Vanity Fair."' 'I presume a dissenter—has that anything to do with John Bunyan's book?' 'Not exactly; I have also written "Pendennis."' 'Never heard of these works; but no doubt they are proper books.' 'I have also contributed to "Punch."' '"Punch!"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_46">I have heard of</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_47">that</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_48">; is it not a ribald publication?'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_49">An invitation to deliver the lectures in America speedily followed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_50">The public interest which heralded his coming in the United States was such as could hardly have been expected for a writer of fiction who had won his fame by so little appeal to the love of exciting scenes.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_51">His visit (as an American critic remarked at the time) at least demonstrated that if they were unwilling to pay English authors for their books, they were ready to reward them handsomely for the opportunity of seeing and hearing them.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_52">At first the public feeling on the other side of the Atlantic had been very much divided as to his probable reception.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_53">'He'll come and humbug us, eat our dinners, pocket our money, and go home and abuse us, like Dickens,' said Jonathan, chafing with the remembrance of that grand ball at the Park Theatre, and the Boz tableaux, and the universal speaking and dining, to which the author of 'Pickwick' was subject while he was their guest.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_54">'Let him have his say,' said others, 'and we will have our look.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_55">We will pay a dollar to hear him, if we can see him at the same time; and as for the abuse, why it takes even more than two such cubs of the roaring British lion to frighten the American eagle.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_56">Let him come, and give him fair play.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_57">He did come, and certainly had fair play; and as certainly there was no disappointment with his lectures.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_58">Those who knew his books found the author in the lecturer.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_59">Those who did not know the books, says one enthusiastic</span>
<a id="Page_174" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="174">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_60">critic, 'were charmed in the lecturer by what is charming in the author—the unaffected humanity, the tenderness, the sweetness, the genial play of fancy, and the sad touch of truth, with that glancing stroke of satire which, lightning-like, illumines while it withers.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_61">He did not visit the West, nor Canada.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_62">He went home without seeing Niagara Falls.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_63">But wherever he did go, he found a generous social welcome, and a respectful and sympathetic hearing.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_64">He came to fulfil no mission; but it was felt that his visit had knit more closely the sympathy of the Americans with Englishmen.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_65">Heralded by various romantic memoirs, he smiled at them, stoutly asserted that he had been always able to command a good dinner, and to pay for it, nor did he seek to disguise that he hoped his American tour would help him to command and pay for more.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_66">He promised not to write a book about the Americans, and he kept his word.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_69">Another 'Spectator'</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_70">Before many days the publishers told the world that the subject of Thackeray's talk had given rise to a Swift and Congreve and Addison furore.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_71">The booksellers were driving a thrifty trade in forgotten volumes of 'Old English Essayists;' the 'Spectator' found its way again to the parlour tables; old Sir Roger de Coverley was waked up from his long sleep.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_72">'Tristram</span>

</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_73">Shandy' even was almost forgiven his lewdness, and the Ass of Melun and Poor Le Fevre were studied wistfully, and placed on the library table between 'Gulliver' and the 'Rake's Progress.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_74">Girls were working Maria's pet lamb upon their samplers, and hundreds of Lilliput literary ladies were twitching the mammoth Gulliver's whiskers.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_75">The newspaper gossipers were no less busy in noting every personal characteristic of the author.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_76">One remarks: 'As for the man himself who has lectured us, he is a stout, healthful, broad-shouldered specimen of a man, with cropped greyish hair, and keenish grey eyes, peering very sharply through a pair of spectacles that have a very satiric focus.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_77">He seems to stand strongly on his own feet, as if he would not be easily blown about or upset, either by praise or pugilists; a man of good digestion, who takes the world easy, and scents all shams and humours (straightening them between his thumb and forefinger) as he would a pinch of snuff.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_78">A London letter of the time says: 'The New York journalists preserve, on the whole, a delicate silence (very creditable to them) on the subject of Mr. Thackeray's nose; but they are eloquent about his legs; and when the last mail left a controversy was raging among them on this matter, one party maintaining that "he stands very firm on his legs," while the opposition asserted that his legs were decidedly "shaky."'</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_79">These, however, were light matters compared with the notices in other newspapers, which unscrupulously raked together, for the amusement of their readers, details which were mostly untrue, and where true, were of too private a character for public discussion.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_80">This led to a humorous remonstrance, forwarded by Thackeray to 'Fraser's Magazine,' where it appeared with the signature of 'John Small.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_81">In this he gave a droll parody of his newspaper biographers' style, which caused some resentment on the part of the writers attacked.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_82">One Transatlantic defender of the New York press said that 'the two most personal accounts of Thackeray</span>
<a id="Page_176" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="176">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_83">published appeared in one of the Liverpool papers, and in the London "Spectator;"' adding, 'the London correspondents of some of the provincial papers spare nothing of fact or comment touching the private life of public characters.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_84">Nay, are there not journals expressly devoted to the contemporary biography of titled, wealthy, and consequential personages, which will tell you how, and in what company, they eat, drink, and travel; their itinerary from the country to London, and from the metropolis to the Continent; the probable marriages, alliances,</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_85">c.?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_86">No journal can be better acquainted with these conditions of English society than the classical and vivacious "Fraser."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_87">Why, then, does John Small address that London editor from New York, converting some paltry and innocent-enough penny-a-liner notice of the author of "Vanity Fair" into an enormous national sin and delinquency?'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_88">Among the lectures delivered at New York, before he quitted the gay circles of the 'Empire City' for Boston, was one in behalf of a charity; and the charity lecture was stated to be a</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_89">mélange</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_90">of all the others, closing very appropriately with an animated tribute to the various literary, social, and humane qualities of Charles Dickens.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_91">'Papa,' he described his daughter as exclaiming, with childish candour; 'papa, I like Mr. Dickens's book much better than yours.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_92">The remonstrance of John Small in 'Fraser,' however, did not conclude without a warm acknowledgment of the general kindness he had received in America, thus feelingly expressed in his last lecture of the series, delivered on April 7.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_93">'In England,' he said, 'it was my custom, after the delivery of these lectures, to point such a moral as seemed to befit the country I lived in, and to protest against an outcry which some brother authors of mine most imprudently and unjustly raise, when they say that our profession is neglected and its professors held in light esteem.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_94">Speaking in this country, I would say that such a complaint could not only not be advanced, but could not even be understood here, where your men of letters take their manly share in public life; whence Everett goes as minister to Washington, and Irving and Bancroft to represent the Republic in the old country.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_95">And if to English authors the English public is, as I believe, kind and just in the main, can any of us say, will any who visit your country not proudly and gratefully own, with what a cordial and generous</span>
<a id="Page_177" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="177">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_96">greeting you receive us?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_97">I look around on this great company.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_98">I think of my gallant young patrons of the Mercantile Library Association, as whose servant I appear before you, and of the kind hand stretched out to welcome me by men famous in letters, and honoured in our own country as in their own, and I thank you and them for a most kindly greeting and a most generous hospitality.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_99">At home and amongst his own people it scarce becomes an English writer to speak of himself; his public estimation must depend on his works; his private esteem on his character and his life.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_100">But here, among friends newly found, I ask leave to say that I am thankful; and I think with a grateful heart of those I leave behind me at home, who will be proud of the welcome you hold out to me, and will benefit, please God, when my days of work are over, by the kindness which you show to their father.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_101">A still more interesting paper was his Preface to Messrs. Appleton and Co.'s New York edition of his minor works.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_102">Readers will remember Thackeray's droll account, in one of his lectures, of his first interview with the agent of Appleton and Co., when holding on, sea-sick, to the bulwarks of the New York steam-vessel on his outward voyage.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_103">The preface referred to contains evidence that the appeal of the energetic representative of that well-known publishing house was not altogether fruitless.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_104">It is as follows:—</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_105">'On coming into this country I found that the projectors of this series of little books had preceded my arrival by publishing a number of early works, which have appeared under various pseudonyms during the last fifteen years.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_106">I was not the master to choose what stories of mine should appear or not; these miscellanies were all advertised, or in course of publication; nor have I had the good fortune to be able to draw a pen, or alter a blunder of author or printer, except in the case of the accompanying volumes which contain contributions to "Punch," whence I have been enabled to make something like a selection.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_107">In the "Letters of Mr. Brown," and the succeeding short essays and descriptive pieces, something graver and less burlesque was attempted than in other pieces which I here publish.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_108">My friend, the "Fat Contributor," accompanied Mr. Titmarsh in his "Journey from Cornhill to Cairo."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_109">The prize novels contain imitations of</span>
<a id="Page_178" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="178">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_110">the writings of some contemporaries who still live and flourish in the novelists' calling.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_111">I myself had scarcely entered on it when these burlesque tales were begun, and I stopped further parody from a sense that this merry task of making fun of the novelists should be left to younger hands than my own; and in a little book published some four years since, in England, by my friends Messrs. Hannay and Shirley Brooks, I saw a caricature of myself and writings to the full as ludicrous and faithful as the prize novels of Mr. Punch.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_112">Nor was there, had I desired it, any possibility of preventing the re-appearance of these performances.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_113">Other publishers, besides the Messrs. Appleton, were ready to bring my hidden works to the light.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_114">Very many of the other books printed I have not seen since their appearance twelve years ago, and it was with no small feelings of curiosity (remembering under what sad circumstances the tale had been left unfinished) that I bought the incomplete "Shabby Genteel Story," in a railway car, on my first journey from Boston hither, from a rosy-cheeked, little peripatetic book merchant, who called out "Thackeray's Works" in such a kind, gay voice, as gave me a feeling of friendship and welcome.</span>

</div>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_115">'There is an opportunity of being either satiric or sentimental.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_116">The careless papers written at an early period, and never seen since the printer's boy carried them away, are brought back and laid at the father's door; and he cannot, if he would, forget or disown his own children.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_117">'Why were some of the little brats brought out of their obscurity?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_118">I own to a feeling of anything but pleasure in reviewing some of these misshapen juvenile creatures, which the publisher has disinterred and resuscitated.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_119">There are two performances especially (among the critical and biographical works of the erudite Mr. Yellowplush) which I am very sorry to see reproduced; and I ask pardon of the author of the "Caxtons" for a lampoon, which I know he himself has forgiven, and which I wish I could recall.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_120">'I had never seen that eminent writer but once in public when this satire was penned, and wonder at the recklessness of the young man who could fancy such personality was harmless</span>
<a id="Page_179" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="179">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_121">jocularity, and never calculate that it might give pain.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_122">The best experiences of my life have been gained since that time of youth and gaiety, and careless laughter.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_123">I allude to them, perhaps, because I would not have any kind and friendly American reader judge of me by the wild performances of early years.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_124">Such a retrospect as the sight of these old acquaintances perforce occasioned cannot, if it would, be gay.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_125">The old scenes return, the remembrance of the bygone time, the chamber in which the stories were written, the faces that shone round the table.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_126">'Some biographers in this country have been pleased to depict that homely apartment after a very strange and romantic fashion; and an author in the direst struggles of poverty, waited upon by a family domestic in "all the splendour of his menial decorations," has been circumstantially described to the reader's amusement as well as to the writer's own.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_127">I may be permitted to assure the former that the splendour and the want were alike fanciful, and that the meals were not only sufficient but honestly paid for.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_128">'That extreme liberality with which American publishers have printed the works of English authors has had at least this beneficial result for us, that our names and writings are known by multitudes using our common mother tongue, who never had heard of us or our books but for the speculators who have sent them all over this continent.</span>
</p>

<span id="SENTENCE_132">'If I have to complain of any special hardship, it is not that our favourite works are reproduced, and our children introduced to the American public—children whom we have educated with care, and in whom we take a little paternal pride—but that ancient magazines are ransacked, and shabby old articles dragged out, which we had gladly left in the wardrobes where they have lain hidden many years.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_133">There is no control, however, over a man's thoughts—once uttered and printed, back they may come upon us on any sudden day; and in this collection which Messrs. Appleton are publishing I find two or three such early productions of my own that I gladly would take back, but that they have long since gone out of the paternal guardianship.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_134">'If not printed in this series, they would have appeared from other presses, having not the slightest need of the author's own imprimatur; and I cannot sufficiently condole with a literary gentleman of this city, who (in his voyages of professional adventure) came upon an early performance of mine, which shall be nameless, carried the news of the discovery to a publisher of books, and had actually done me the favour to sell my book to that liberal man; when, behold, Messrs. Appleton announced the book in the press, and my</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_135">confrère</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_136">had to refund the prize-money which had been paid to him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_137">And if he is a little chagrined at finding other intrepid voyagers beforehand with him in taking possession of my island, and the American flag already floating there, he will understand the feelings of the harmless but kindly-treated aboriginal, who makes every sign of peace, who smokes the pipe of submission, and meekly acquiesces in his own annexation.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_138">'It is said that those only who win should laugh: I think, in this case, my readers will not grudge the losing side its share of harmless good-humour.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_139">If I have contributed to theirs, or provided them with means of amusement, I am glad to think my books have found favour with the American public, as I am proud to own the great and cordial welcome with which they have received me.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_145">The publication of the 'Adventures of Henry Esmond,' which appeared just as its author was starting for America in 1852, marked an important epoch in his career.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_146">It was a continuous story, and one worked out with closer attention to the thread of the narrative than he had hitherto produced—a fact due, no doubt, partly to its appearance in three volumes complete, instead of in detached monthly portions.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_147">But its most striking feature was its elaborate imitation of the style and even the manner of thought of the time of Queen Anne's reign, in which its scenes were laid.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_148">The preparation of his Lectures on the Humourists had no doubt suggested to him the idea of writing a story of this kind, as it afterwards suggested to him the design of writing a history of that period which he had long entertained, but in which he had, we believe, made no progress when he died.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_149">But his fondness for the Queen Anne writers was of older date.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_150">Affectionate allusions to Sir Richard Steele—like himself a Charterhouse boy—and to Addison, and Pope, and Swift, may be found in his earliest magazine articles.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_151">That the style with which the author of 'Vanity</span>
<a id="Page_182" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="182">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_152">Fair' and 'Pendennis' had so often delighted his readers was to some degree formed upon those models so little studied in his boyhood, cannot be doubted by anyone who is familiar with the literature of the 'Augustan age of English authorship.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_153">The writers of that period were fond of French models, as the writers of Elizabeth's time looked to Italy for their literary inspiration; but there was no time when English prose was generally written with more purity and ease; for the translation of the Scriptures, which is generally referred to as an evidence of the perfection of our English speech in Elizabeth's time, owed its strength and simplicity chiefly to the rejection by the pious translators of the scholarly style most in vogue, in favour of the homely English then current among the people.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_154">If we except the pamphlet writers of earlier reigns, the Queen Anne writers were the first who systematically wrote for the people in plain Saxon English, not easy to imitate in these days.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_155">'Esmond' was from the first most liked among literary men who can appreciate a style having no resemblance to the fashion of the day; but there was a vein of tenderness and true pathos in the story which, in spite of some objectionable features in the plot, and of a somewhat wearisome genealogical introduction, has by degrees gained for it a high rank among the author's works.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_156">'Esmond' was followed by the 'Newcomes,' in 1855, a work which revealed a deeper pathos than any of his previous novels, and showed that the author could, when he pleased, give us pictures of moral beauty and exquisite tenderness.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_157">In this work he returned to the yellow numbers in the old monthly form.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_162">Upon which the author felt it worth his while to explain the real sense of the offending paragraph in a letter to that journal, and, in the concluding paragraph, he very explicitly sets forth his own sincere convictions in regard to the hero of American Independence, and his belief in the justice of the cause for which he conquered.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_166">Another journey to the United States, equally successful, and equally profitable in a pecuniary sense, was the chief event in his life in 1856.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_167">The lectures delivered were those admirable anecdotal and reflective discourses on the 'Four Georges,' made familiar</span>
<a id="Page_184" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="184">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_168">to readers by their publication in the 'Cornhill Magazine,' and since then in a separate form.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_169">The subject was not favourable to the display of the author's more genial qualities.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_170">But where in English literature could we find anything more solemn and affecting than his picture of the old king, the third of that name?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_171">When 'all light, all reason, all sound of human voices, all the pleasures of this world of God were taken from him'—concluding with the affecting appeal to his American audience—'O brothers! speaking the same dear mother tongue—O comrades! enemies no more, let us take a mournful hand together as we stand by this royal corpse, and call a truce to battle!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_172">Low he lies to whom the proudest used to kneel once, and who was cast lower than the poorest—dead whom millions prayed for in vain.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_173">Hush, Strife and Quarrels, over the solemn grave!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_174">Sound, Trumpets, a mournful march.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_175">Fall, Dark Curtain, upon his pageant, his pride, his grief, his awful tragedy!'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_176">These lectures were successfully repeated in England.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_177">Thackeray, indeed, was now recognised as one of the most attractive lecturers of the day.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_178">His presence, whether in lecturing on the 'Georges' for his own profit, or on 'Week-day Preachers,' or some other topic for the benefit of the families of deceased brother writers, such as he delivered to assist in raising monuments to the memories of Angus B. Reach and Douglas Jerrold, always attracted the most cultivated classes of the various cities in which he appeared; but an attempt to draw together a large audience of the less-educated classes by giving a course of lectures at the great Music Hall was less happy.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_179">In Edinburgh his reception was always in the highest degree successful.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_180">He was more extensively known and admired among the intellectual portion of the people of Scotland than any living writer, not excepting Thomas Carlyle.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_181">There was something in his peculiar genius that commended him to the Northern temperament.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_182">Thackeray delivered his essays on the 'Four Georges' in Scotland to larger and more intellectual audiences than have probably flocked to any other lecturer, and he, later on, lectured there for the benefit of Angus B. Reach's widow.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_183">Nearly all the men of Edinburgh, with any tincture of literature, had met him</span>
<a id="Page_185" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="185">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_184">personally, and a few knew him well.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_185">He was almost the only great author that the majority of the lovers of literature in it had seen and heard, and his form and figure and voice, with its tragic tones and pauses, well entitled him to take his place in any ideal rank of giants.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_186">He was much gratified (says James Hannay) by the success of the 'Four Georges' (a series which superseded an earlier scheme for as many discourses on 'Men of the World') in Scotland.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_187">'I have had three per cent. of the whole population here,' he wrote from Edinburgh in November 1856.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_188">'If I could but get three per cent. out of London!'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_189">Most of Thackeray's readers will remember that in 1857 he was invited by some friends to offer himself as a candidate for the representation in Parliament of the city of Oxford.</span>

<p class="center c2">
<span id="SENTENCE_202">Preface to the Edition of 1732.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_203">This little book had six editions between 1628 and 1633, without any author's name to recommend it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_204">An eighth edition is spoken of in 1664.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_205">The present is reprinted from the edition of 1633, without altering anything but the plain errors of the press, and the old printing and spelling in some places.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_206">The language is generally easy, and proves our English tongue not to be so very changeable as is commonly supposed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_207">The change of fashions unavoidably casts a shade upon a few places, yet even those contain an exact picture of the age wherein they were written, as the rest does of mankind in general; for reflections founded upon nature will be just in the main, as long as men are men, though the particular instances of vice and folly may be diversified.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_208">Perhaps these valuable essays may be as acceptable to the public as they were at first; both for the entertainment of those who are already experienced in the ways of mankind, and for the information of others who would know the world the best way, that is—without trying it.</span>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_210">'This entertaining little book is become rather scarce, and is replete with so much good sense and genuine humour, which, though in part adapted to the times when it first appeared, seems on the whole by no means inapplicable to any era of mankind.'</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_211">Earle's 'Microcosmography' is undoubtedly a favourable example of the quaint epigrammatic wisdom of the early English writers, and few could question the appropriateness of the pencil which has lightly margined the settings of these terse and sterling essays, to the wisdom and humour of which the happiest productions of later essayists can but be appreciatively likened.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_212">Concerning the profoundly accomplished and eminently modest author, 'a most eloquent and powerful preacher, a man of great piety and devotion; and of a conversation so pleasant and delightful, so very innocent, and so very facetious, that no man's company was more desired and more loved; no man was more negligent in his dress, habit, and mien, no man more wary and cultivated in his behaviour and discourse; insomuch as he had the greater advantage when he was known, by promising so little before,' we may accept the testimony of Lord Clarendon's 'Account of his own Life.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_213">The observations of the great Chancellor are supplemented by the character which honest Isaac Walton has sketched of this estimable prelate in his 'Life of Hooker.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_229">We laugh at his foolish sports, but his game is our earnest, and his drums, rattles, and hobby-horses, but the emblems and mocking of man's business.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_230">His father hath writ him as his own little story, wherein he reads those days of his life that he cannot remember, and sighs to see what innocence he hath outlived.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_235">An upstart country knight is a holiday clown, and differs only in the stuff of his clothes, not the stuff of himself, for he bare the king's sword before he had arms to wield it; yet being once laid o'er the shoulder with a knighthood, he finds the herald his friend.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_236">His father was a man of good stock, though but a tanner or usurer; he purchased the land, and his son the title.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_237">He has doffed off the name of a country lout, but the look not so easy, and his face still bears a relish of churn milk.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_238">He is guarded with more gold lace than all the gentlemen of the country, yet his body makes his clothes still out of fashion.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_244">In sum, he's but a clod of his own earth, or his land is the dunghill, and he the cock that crows over it; and commonly his race is quickly run, and his children's children, though they 'scape hanging, return to the place from whence they came.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_246">A plain country-fellow is one that manures his ground well, but lets himself lie fallow and untilled.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_247">He has reason enough to do his business, and not enough to be idle and melancholy.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_248">He seems to have the punishment of Nebuchadnezzar, for his conversation is among beasts, and his talons none of the shortest, only he eats not grass because he loves not salads.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_249">His hand guides the plough, and the plough his thoughts, and his ditch and landmark is the very mound of his meditations.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_250">He expostulates with his oxen very understandingly, and speaks gee, and ree, better than English.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_251">His mind is not much distracted with objects, but if a good fat sow come in his way, he stands dumb and astonished, and though his haste be never so great, will fix</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_254">His dinner is his other work, for he sweats at it as much as at his labour; he is a terrible fastener on a piece of beef, and you may hope to stave the guard off sooner.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_255">His religion is part of his copyhold, which he takes from his landlord, and refers it wholly to his discretion.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_256">Yet if he give him leave he is a good Christian to his power—that is, comes to church in his best clothes, and sits there with his neighbours, where he is capable only of two prayers, for rain, and fair weather.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_257">He apprehends God's blessings only in a good year, or a fat pasture, and never praises Him but on</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_260">Sunday he esteems a day to make merry in, and thinks a bagpipe as essential to it as evening prayer, when he walks very solemnly after service with his hands coupled behind him, and censures the dancing of his parish.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_261">His compliment with his neighbour is a good thump on the back, and his salutation commonly some blunt curse.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_262">He thinks nothing to be vices, but pride and ill husbandry, from which he will gravely dissuade the youth, and has some thrifty hob-nail proverbs to clout his discourse.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_263">He is a niggard all the week, except only market days, when, if his corn sell well, he thinks he may be drunk with a good conscience.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_264">He is sensible of no calamity but the burning of a stack of corn, or the overflowing of a meadow, and thinks Noah's flood the greatest plague that ever was, not because it drowned the world, but spoiled the grass.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_265">For death he is never troubled, and if he get in but his harvest before, let it come when it will, he cares not.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_266">A Pot Poet.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_267">A pot poet is the dregs of wit, yet mingled with good drink may have some relish.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_268">His inspirations are more real than others, for they do but feign a god, but he has his by him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_269">His verse runs like the tap, and his invention as the barrel ebbs and flows at the mercy of the spiggot.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_270">In thin drink he aspires not above a ballad, but a cup of sack inflames him, and sets his muse and nose a-fire</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_271">together.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_272">The press is his mint, and stamps him now and then a sixpence or two in reward of the baser coin, his pamphlet.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_273">His works would scarce sell for three halfpence, though they are given oft for three shillings, but for the pretty title that allures the country gentleman; for which the printer maintains him in ale for a fortnight.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_274">His verses are, like his clothes, miserable stolen scraps and patches, yet their pace is not altogether so hobbling as an almanac's.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_275">The death of a great man, or the burning of a house, furnish him with an argument, and the nine muses are out strait in mourning gowns, and Melpomene cries 'Fire! fire!'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_276">His other poems are but briefs in rhyme, and, like the poor Greek's collections, to redeem from captivity.</span>
