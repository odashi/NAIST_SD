<span id="SENTENCE_2">ENGLISH ESSAYISTS OF THE GEORGIAN ERA.</span>
</span>
</h2>
<p class="ch_summ">
<span id="SENTENCE_3">Early Essayists whose Writings have furnished Thackeray with the Accessories of Portions of his Novels and Lectures—Works from the Novelist's Library, elucidating his Course of Reading for the Preparation of his 'Lectures'—'Henry Esmond,' 'The Virginians,'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_4">c.—Characteristic Passages from the Lucubrations of the Essayists of the Augustan Era illustrated with original marginal Sketches, suggested by the Text, by Thackeray's Hand—The 'Tatler'—Its History and Influence—Reforms introduced by the purer Style of the Essayists—The Literature of Queen Anne's Reign—Thackeray's Love for the Writings of that Period—His Gift of reproducing their masterly and simple Style of Composition; their Irony, and playful Humour—Extracts from notable Essays; illustrated with original Pencillings from the Series of the 'Tatler,' 1709.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_5">The commencement of the eighteenth century has been christened the Augustan Era of English literature, from the brilliant assembly of writers, pre-eminent for their wit, genius, and cultivation, who then enriched our literature with a perfectly original school of humour.</span>
</p>
<div class="figleft">

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_6">The essayists, to whose accomplished parts we are indebted for the 'Tatlers,' 'Spectators,' 'Guardians,' 'Humorists,' 'Worlds,' 'Connoisseurs,' 'Mirrors,' 'Adventurers,' 'Observers,' 'Loungers,' 'Lookers-on,' 'Ramblers,' and kindred papers, which picture the many-coloured scenes of our society and literature, have conferred a lasting benefit upon posterity by the sterling merit of their writings.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_7">It has been justly said that these essays, by their intrinsic worth, have outlived many revolutions of taste, and have attained unrivalled</span>
<a id="Page_222" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="222">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_8">popularity and classic fame, while multitudes of their contemporaries, successors, and imitators have perished with the accidents or caprices of fashion.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_9">The general purpose of the essayists as laid down by Steele, who may be considered foremost among the originators of the familiar school of writing, 'was to expose the false arts of life, to pull off the disguises of cunning, vanity, and affectation, and to recommend a general simplicity in our dress, our discourse, and our behaviour.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_10">Bickerstaff's lucubrations were directed to good-humoured exposures of those freaks and vagaries of life, 'too trivial for the chastisement of the law and too fantastical for the cognisance of the pulpit,' of those failings, according to Addison's summary of their purpose in the 'Spectator' (No. 34), thus harmonised by Pope:—</span>
</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_11">Safe from the bar, the pulpit, and the throne,</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_12">Yet touched and shamed by Ridicule alone.</span>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_13">The graceful philosophers, polished wits and playful satirists exerted their abilities to supply 'those temporary demands and casual exigencies, overlooked by graver writers and more bulky theorists,' to bring, in the language of Addison, 'philosophy out of closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and in coffee-houses.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_14">'The method of conveying cheap and easy knowledge began among us in the civil wars, when it was much the interest of either party to raise and fix the prejudices of the people.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_15">It was in this spirit that the oft-mentioned Mercuries, 'Mercurius Aulicus,' 'Mercurius Rusticus,' and 'Mercurius Civicus' first appeared.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_16">A hint of the original plan of the 'Tatler' may in some degree be traced to Defoe's 'Review; consisting of a Scandal Club, on Questions of Theology, Morals, Politics, Trade, Language, Poetry,</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_17">c.,' published about the year 1703.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_18">'The "Tatler,"' writes Dr. Chalmers, 'like many other ancient superstructures, rose from small beginnings.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_19">It does not appear that the author (Steele) foresaw to what perfection this method of writing could be brought.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_20">By dividing each paper into compartments, he appears to have consulted the ease with which an author may say a little upon many subjects, who has neither leisure nor inclination to enter deeply on a single topic.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_21">This, however, did not proceed either from distrust in his abilities, or in</span>
<a id="Page_223" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="223">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_22">the favour of the public; for he at once addressed them with confidence and familiarity; but it is probable that he did not foresee to what perfection the continued practice of writing will frequently lead a man whose natural endowments are wit and eloquence, superadded to a knowledge of the world, and a habit of observation.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_23">The first number of the 'Tatler' bore the motto,</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_30">The original sheet appeared on Tuesday, April 12, 1709,</span>
<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@44563@44563-h@44563-h-19.htm.html#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor pginternal" id="FNanchor_13">
<span id="SENTENCE_31">[13]</span>
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_32">and the days of its publication were fixed to be Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_33">'In the selection of a name for the work, Steele affords an early instance of delicate raillery, by informing us that the name "Tatler" was invented in</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_34">honour</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_35">of the fair sex; and that in such a character he might indulge with impunity the desultory plan he first laid down, with a becoming imitation of the tattle and gossip of the day.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_36">The first four numbers were given gratis, the price was then fixed at a penny, which was afterwards doubled.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_37">Steele, whose humour was most happily adapted to his task, assumed as censor of manners the alias of Isaac Bickerstaff.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_38">'Throughout the whole work,' writes Beattie, 'the conjuror, the politician, the man of humour, the critic; the seriousness of the moralist, and the mock dignity of the astrologer; the vivacities and infirmities peculiar to old age, are all so blended and contrasted in the censor of Great Britain as to form a character equally complex and natural, equally laughable and respectable,' and as the editor declares, in his proper person, 'the attacks upon prevailing and fashionable vices had been carried forward by Mr. Bickerstaff with a freedom of spirit that would have lost its attraction and efficacy, had it been pretended to by</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_39">Mr. Steele</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_40">.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_41">A scarce pamphlet, attributed to Gay, draws attention to the</span>
<a id="Page_224" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="224">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_42">high moral and philosophic purpose which was entertained originally.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_43">'There was this difference between Steele and all the rest of the polite and gallant authors of the time: the latter endeavoured to please the age by falling in with them, and encouraging them in their fashionable vices and false notions of things.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_44">It would have been a jest some time since for a man to have asserted that anything witty could have been said in praise of a married state; or that devotion and virtue were any way necessary to the character of a fine gentleman.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_45">Bickerstaff ventured to tell the town that they were a parcel of fops, fools, and vain coquettes; but in such a manner as even pleased them, and made them more than half inclined to believe that he spoke truth.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_46">The humorists of the Augustan era were, as the world knows, peculiar objects of regard to the great writer of 'Roundabout Essays' in the age of Queen Victoria.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_47">Novels, lectures, and reviews alike prove the industry and affection with which Thackeray conducted his researches amidst the veins of singular richness and congenial material opened to him by the lives and writings of these famous essayists, in such profusion that selection became a point of real art.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_48">It is not difficult to trace the results of Thackeray's reading among his favourite writers, or to watch its influence on his own compositions.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_49">Nor did his regard for these sources of inspiration pass the bounds of reasonable admiration; he argues convincingly of the authentic importance of his chosen authorities.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_50">From his minute and intelligent studies of the works of these genial humorists Thackeray acquired a remarkable facility of thinking, spontaneously acknowledged by all his contemporaries, with the felicitous aptitude of the originals, and learned to express his conceptions in language simple, lucid, and sparkling as the outpourings from those pure fonts for which his eagerness may be said to have been unquenched to the end of his career.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_51">That artist-like local colouring which gives such scholarly value to 'Henry Esmond,' to the 'Virginians,' to the 'Humorists of the Eighteenth Century,' and which was no less manifest in the work which engaged his thoughts when Death lightly touched the novelist's hand, furnishes the evidence of Thackeray's familiarity with, and command of, the quaintest, wittiest, wisest, and pleasantest writings in our language.</span>
<a id="Page_225" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="225">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_52">It will be felt by readers who realise Thackeray in his familiar association with the kindred early humorists, that the merry passages his pencil has italicised by droll marginal sketches are, with all their suggestive slightness, in no degree unworthy of the conceits to which they give a new interest; while in some cases, with playful whimsicality, they present a reading entirely novel.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_53">The fidelity of costume and appointments, even in this miniature state, confirms the diligence and thought with which the author of 'Henry Esmond' pursued every detail which illustrated his cherished period, and which might serve as a basis for its consistent reconstruction, to carry his reader far back up the stream of time.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_54">The necessity of compressing within the limits of this volume our selections from the comparatively exhaustless field of the humorous essayists, necessarily renders the paragraphs elucidated by Thackeray's quaint etchings somewhat fragmentary and abrupt, while the miscellaneous nature of the topics thus indiscriminately touched on may be best set forth according to the advertisement with which Swift ushered in his memorable 'Number One':</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_84">'This was long ago a witty author's lamentation, but the evil still continues; and if a man of any delicacy were to attend the discourses of the young fellows of this age, he would believe there were none but the fallen to make the objects of passion.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_85">So true it is what the author of the above verses said, a little before his death, of the modern pretenders to gallantry: "They set up for wits in this age, by saying, when they are sober, what they of the last spoke only when they were drunk."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_86">But Cupid is not only blind at present, but dead drunk; and he has lost all his faculties; else how should Celia be so long a maid, with that agreeable behaviour?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_87">Corinna, with that sprightly wit?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_88">Serbia, with that heavenly voice? and Sacharissa, with all those excellences in one person, frequent the park, the play, and murder the poor Tits that drag her to public places, and not a man turn pale at her appearance?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_89">But such is the fallen state of love, that if it were not for honest Cynthio, who is true to the cause, we should hardly have a pattern left of the ancient worthies in that way; and indeed he has but very little encouragement to persevere.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_90">Though Cynthio has wit, good sense, fortune, and his very being depends upon her, the termagant for whom he sighs is in love with a fellow who stares in the glass all the time he is with her, and lets her plainly see she may possibly be his rival, but never his mistress.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_91">Yet Cynthio pleases himself with a vain imagination that, with the language of his eyes, now he has found out who she is, he shall conquer her, though her eyes are intent upon one who looks from her, which is ordinary with the sex.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_92">'It is certainly a mistake in the ancients to draw the little gentleman</span>
<a id="Page_227" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="227">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_93">Love as a blind boy, for his real character is a little thief that squints; for ask Mrs. Meddle, who is a confidante or spy upon all the passions in town, and she will tell you that the whole is a game of cross purposes.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_94">The lover is generally pursuing one who is in pursuit of another, and running from one that desires to meet him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_95">Nay, the nature of this passion is so justly represented in a squinting little thief (who is always in a double action), that do but observe Clarissa next time you see her, and you will find, when her eyes have made their soft tour round the company she makes no stay on him they say she is to marry, but rests two seconds of a minute on Wildair, who neither looks nor thinks on her or any woman else.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_96">However, Cynthio had a bow from her the other day, upon which he is very much come to himself; and I heard him send his man of an errand yesterday, without any manner of hesitation; a quarter of an hour after which he reckoned twenty, remembered he was to sup with a friend, and went exactly to his appointment.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_97">I sent to know how he did this morning, and I find he hath not forgotten that he spoke to me yesterday.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_111">Here Parisatis heard her niece nestle closer to the key-hole.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_112">She then goes on: "Make her the joyful mother of a numerous and wealthy offspring; and let her carriage be such as may make this noble youth expect the blessings of a happy marriage, from the singularity of her life, in this loose and censorious age."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_113">Miss, having heard enough, sneaks off for fear of discovery, and immediately at her glass, alters the setting of her head; then pulls up her tucker, and forms herself into the exact manner of Lindamira; in a word, becomes a sincere convert to everything that is commendable in a fine young lady; and two or three such matches as her aunt feigned in her devotions are at this day in her choice.</span>

</p>
<p class="left65">
<span id="SENTENCE_190">'Epsom, June 28.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_191">'It is now almost three weeks since what you writ about happened in this place.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_192">The quarrel between my friends did not run so high as I find your accounts have made it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_193">You are to understand that the persons concerned in this scene were Lady Autumn and Lady Springly.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_194">Autumn is a person of good breeding, formality, and a singular way practised in the last age; and Lady Springly, a modern impertinent of our sex, who affects as improper a familiarity as the other does distance.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_195">These heroines have married two brothers, both knights.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_196">Springly is the spouse of the elder, who is a baronet, and Autumn, being a rich widow, has taken the younger, and her purse endowed him with an equal fortune, and knighthood of the same order.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_197">This jumble of titles, you need not doubt, has been an aching torment to Autumn, who took place of the other on no pretence but her carelessness and disregard of distinction.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_198">The secret occasion of envy broiled long in the breast of Autumn; but no opportunity of contention on that subject happening, kept all things quiet until the accident of which you demand an account.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_199">'It was given out among all the gay people of this place, that on the ninth instant several damsels, swift of foot, were to run for a suit of head-cloaths at the Old Wells.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_200">Lady Autumn, on this occasion, invited Springly to go with her in her coach to see the race.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_201">When they came to the place, where the Governor of Epsom and all his court of citizens were assembled, as well as a crowd of people of all orders, a brisk young fellow addressed himself to the younger of the ladies, viz.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_202">Springly, and offers her his services to conduct her into the music-room.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_203">Springly accepts the compliment, and is led triumphantly through a bowing crowd, while Autumn is left among the rabble, and has much ado to get back into her coach; but she did it at last, and as it is usual to see, by the horses, my lady's present disposition, she orders John to whip furiously home to her husband; where, when she enters, down she sits, began to unpin her hood, and lament her foolish fond heart to marry into a family where she was so</span>
<a id="Page_234" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="234">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_204">little regarded.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_205">Lady Springly, an hour or two after, returns from the Wells, and finds the whole company together.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_206">Down she sat, and a profound silence ensued.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_207">You know a premeditated quarrel usually begins and works up with the words</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_208">some people</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_209">.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_210">The silence was broken by Lady Autumn, who began to say, "There are some people who fancy, that if some people"—Springly immediately takes her up, "There are some people who fancy, if other people"—Autumn repartees, "People may give themselves airs; but other people, perhaps, who make less ado, may be, perhaps, as agreeable as people who set themselves out more."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_211">All the other people at the table sat mute, while these two people, who were quarrelling, went on with the use of the word</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_212">people</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_213">, instancing the very accidents between them, as if they kept only in distant hints.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_214">Therefore, says Autumn, reddening, "There are some people will go abroad in other people's coaches, and leave those with whom they went to shift for themselves; and if, perhaps, those people have married the younger brother, yet, perhaps, he may be beholden to those people for what he is."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_215">Springly smartly answers, "People may bring so much ill humour into a family, as people may repent their receiving their money," and goes on—"Everybody is not considerable enough to give her uneasiness."</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_216">'Upon this Autumn comes up to her, and desired her to kiss her, and never to see her again; which her sister refusing, my lady gave her a box on the ear.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_217">Springly returns, "Ay, ay," said she, "I knew well enough you meant me by your some people;" and gives her another on the other side.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_218">To it they went, with most masculine fury; each husband ran in.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_219">The wives immediately fell upon their husbands, and tore periwigs and cravats.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_220">The company interposed; when (according to the slip-knot of matrimony, which makes them return to one another when anyone</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_222">It is said, the governor has sent several joints of mutton, and has proposed divers dishes, very exquisitely dressed, to bring them down again.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_237">Bellfrey went on, and called all the neighbouring parishes into the square.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_238">Never was woman in such confusion as that delicate lady; but there was no stopping her kinsman.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_240">As soon as Bellfrey became silent, up gets my lady, and takes him by the arm, to lead him off.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_299">The 'Tatler' describes an incident of Sir Taffety Trippet, a fortune-hunter, whose follies, according to Mr. Bickerstaff, are too gross to give diversion; and whose vanity is too stupid to let him be sensible that he is a public offence.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_300">'It happened that, when he first set up for a fortune-hunter, he chose Tunbridge for the scene of action, where were at that time two sisters upon the same design.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_301">The knight believed, of course, the elder must be the better prize; and consequently makes all sail that way.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_302">People that want sense do always in an egregious manner want modesty, which made our hero triumph in making his amour as public as was possible.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_303">The adored lady was no less vain of his public addresses.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_304">An attorney with one cause is not half so restless as a woman with one lover.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_305">Wherever they met, they talked to each other aloud, chose each other partner at balls, saluted at the most conspicuous part of the service of the church, and practised, in honour of each other, all the remarkable particularities which are usual for persons who admire one another, and are contemptible to the rest of the world.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_306">These two lovers seemed as much made for each other as Adam and Eve, and all pronounced it a match of nature's own making; but the night before the nuptials, so universally approved, the younger sister, envious of the good fortune even of her sister, who had been present at most of the interviews, and had an equal taste for the charm of a fop, as there are a set of women made for that order of men; the younger, I say, unable to see so rich a prize</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_314">Delamira resigns her Fan.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_315">'When the beauteous Delamira had published her intention of entering the bonds of matrimony, the matchless Virgulta, whose charms had made no satires, thus besought her to confide the secret of her triumphs:—</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_316">'"Delamira! you are now going into that state of life wherein the use of your charms is wholly to be applied to the pleasing only one man.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_317">That swimming air of your body, that jaunty bearing of your head over one shoulder, and that inexpressible beauty in your manner of playing your fan, must be lowered into a more confined behaviour, to show that you would rather shun than receive addresses for the future.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_318">Therefore, dear Delamira, give me those excellences you leave off, and acquaint me with your manner of charming; for I take the liberty of our friendship to say, that when I consider my own stature, motion, complexion, wit, or breeding, I cannot think myself any way your inferior; yet do I go through crowds without wounding a man, and all my acquaintance marry round me while I live a virgin masked, and I think unregarded."</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_319">'Delamira heard her with great attention, and, with that dexterity which is natural to her, told her that "all she had above the rest of her sex and contemporary beauties was wholly owing to a fan (that was left her by her mother, and had been long in the family), which whoever had in possession and used with skill, should command the hearts of all her beholders; and since," said she, smiling, "I have no more to do with extending my conquests or triumphs, I will make you a present of this inestimable rarity."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_320">Virgulta made her expressions of the highest gratitude for so uncommon a confidence in her, and desired she would "show her what was peculiar in the management of that utensil, which rendered it of such general force when</span>
<a id="Page_241" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="241">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_321">she was mistress of it."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_322">Delamira replied, "You see, madam, Cupid is the principal figure painted on it; and the skill in playing the fan is, in your several motions of it, to let him appear as little as possible; for honourable lovers fly all endeavours to ensnare them, and your Cupid must hide his bow and arrow, or he will never be sure of his game.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_323">You observe," continued she, "that in all public assemblies the sexes seem to separate themselves, and draw up to attack each other with eye-shot: that is the time when the fan, which is all the armour of a woman, is of most use in our defence; for our minds are construed by the waving of that little instrument, and our thoughts appear in composure or agitation according to the motion of it."'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_328">The 'Tatler' transcribes from La Bruyère an extract, which he introduces as 'one of the most elegant pieces of raillery and satire.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_329">La Bruyère describes the French as if speaking of a people not yet discovered, in the air and style of a traveller:—</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_330">'I have heard talk of a country where the old men are gallant, polite, and civil; the young men, on the contrary, stubborn, wild, without either manners or civility.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_331">Amongst these people, he is sober who is never drunk with anything but wine; the too frequent use of it having rendered it flat and insipid to them: they endeavour by brandy, or other strong liquors, to quicken their taste, already extinguished, and want nothing to complete their debauches but to drink aqua-fortis.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_332">The women of that country hasten the decay of their beauty by their artifices to preserve it; they paint their cheeks, eye-brows, and shoulders, which they lay open, together with their breasts, arms, and ears, as if they were afraid to hide those places which they think will please, and never think they show enough of them.</span>
