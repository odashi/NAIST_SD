` Many other gentlemen were knocked down and trampled under foot .
Some of them , whom my grandfather 's generosity would never name , betook themselves to flight in a most inglorious
manner .
An earl 's son was spied clinging submissively round the feet of mad Pocklington , the tailor .
A young baronet , although naturally intrepid , was obliged to conceal himself at the bottom of Pippin Kate 's apple-stall .
A Shropshire squire , of three thousand pounds a year , was discovered , chin deep and almost stifled , in Fleet Ditch .
Even Captain Daisy himself was found in a milk-cellar , with visible marks of fear and consternation .
Thus ended this inauspicious day .
But the madmen continued their outrages many days after .
It was near a week before they were all retaken and chained to their cells , and during that interval of liberty they committed many offensive pranks throughout the cities of London and Westminster .
` Such unforeseen disasters occasioned some prudent regulations in the laws of honor .
It was enacted from that time that six combatants -LRB- three on a side -RRB- might be allowed and acknowledged to contain such a quantity of blood in their veins as should be sufficient to satisfy the highest affront that could be offered . '

One of Mr. FitzAdam 's correspondents is describing a morning he spent in the library of Lord Finican , with which nobleman he was invited to breakfast : --
' I now fell to the books with a good appetite , intending to make a full meal ; and while I was chewing upon a piece of Tully 's philosophical writings , my lord came in upon me .
His looks discovered great uneasiness , which I attributed to the effects of the last night 's diversions ; but good manners requiring me to prefer his lordship 's conversation to my own amusement , I replaced his book , and by the sudden satisfaction in his countenance perceived that the cause of his perturbation was my holding open the book with a pinch of snuff in my fingers .
He said he was glad to see me , for he should not have known else what to have done with himself .
I returned the compliment by saying I
thought he could not want entertainment amidst so choice a collection of books .
`` Yes , '' replied he , `` the collection is not without elegance ; but I read men only now , for I finished my studies when I set out on my travels .
You are not the first who has admired my library ; and I am allowed to have as fine a taste in books as any man in England . ''
` Hereupon he showed me a `` Pastor Fido , '' bound in green and decorated with myrtle-leaves .
He then took down a volume of Tillotson , in a black binding , with the leaves as white as a law-book , and gilt on the back with little mitres and crosiers ; and lastly , CÃ¦sar 's `` Commentaries , '' clothed in red and gold , in imitation of the military uniform of English officers . '
The literary gentleman finally elicits that his lordship 's books are simply selected for fashion and show , and that they are never read , Lord Finican having long given up the study of books , and merely collecting a library to establish the excellence of his taste .

Mr. FitzAdam prints a letter received from a widow , describing the real facts of the injuries by which her husband had lost his life in a duel : --
` Mr. Muzzy was very fat and extremely lethargic , and so stupidly heavy that he fell asleep even in musical assemblies , and snored in the playhouse , as loud , poor man ! as he used to snore in bed .
However , having received many taunts and reproaches , he resolved to challenge his own cousin-german , Brigadier Truncheon , of Soho Square .
It seems the person challenged
fixed upon the place and weapons .
Truncheon , a deep-sighted man , chose Primrose Hill for the field of battle , and swords for the weapons of defense .
To avoid suspicion and to prevent a discovery , they were to walk together from Piccadilly , where we then lived , to the summit of Primrose Hill .
Truncheon 's scheme took effect .
Mr. Muzzy was much fatigued and out of breath with the walk .
However , he drew his sword ; and , as he assured me himself , began to attack his cousin with valor .
The brigadier went back ; Mr. Muzzy pursued ; but not having his adversary 's alacrity , he stopped a little to take breath .
He stopped , alas ! too long : his lethargy came on with more than usual violence ; he first dozed as he stood upon his legs , and then beginning to nod forward , dropped by degrees upon his face in a most profound sleep .
` Truncheon , base man ! took this opportunity to wound my husband as he lay snoring on the ground ; and he had the cunning to direct his stab in such a manner as to make it supposed that Mr. Muzzy had fled , and in his flight had received a wound in the most ignominious part of his body .
You will ask what became of the seconds .
They were both killed upon the spot ; but being only two servants , the one a butler and the other a cook , they were buried the same night ; and by the power of a little money , properly applied , no further inquiry was made about them .
` Mr. Muzzy , wounded as he was , might probably have slept upon that spot for many hours , had he not been awakened by the cruel bites of a mastiff .
My poor husband was thoroughly awakened by the new hurt he had received ; and indeed it was impossible to have slept while he was losing whole collops of the fattest and most pulpy part of his flesh : so that he was brought home to me much more wounded by the teeth of the mastiff than
by the sword of his cousin Truncheon . '
The wound eventually mortified , Mr. Muzzy lost his life , and the writer became a widow .

` Led by the jocund train of vernal hours ,
And vernal airs , up rose the gentle May ,
Blushing she rose and blushing rose the flowers
That spring spontaneous in her genial ray .
` Her locks with Heaven 's ambrosial dews were bright ,
And am ` rous Zephyrs flutter 'd on her breast ;
With ev'ry shifting gleam of morning light
The colors shifted of her rainbow vest .
` Imperial ensigns graced her smiling form ,
A golden key and golden wand she bore ;
This charms to peace each sullen eastern storm ,
And that unlocks the summer 's copious store .
` Vain hope , no more in choral bands unite
Her virgin vot ` ries , and at early dawn ,
Sacred to May and Love 's mysterious rite ,
Brush the light dewdrops
-LSB- 26 -RSB-
from the spangled lawn .
` To her no more Augusta 's
-LSB- 27 -RSB-
wealthy pride
Pours the full tribute of Potosi 's mine ;
Nor fresh-blown garlands village maids provide ,
A purer off ` ring at her rustic shrine .
` No more the May-pole 's verdant height around ,
To valor 's games th ' adventurous youth advance ;
To merry bells and tabor 's sprightlier sound
Wake the loud carol and the sportive dance . '
' I have hinted more than once that the present age -LRB- 1754 -RRB- , notwithstanding the vices and follies with which it abounds , has the happiness of standing as high in my opinion as any age whatsoever .
But it has always been the fashion to believe that from the beginning of the world to the present day men have been increasing in wickedness .
' I believe that all vices will be found to exist amongst us much in the same degree as heretofore , forms only changing .
` Our grandfathers used to get drunk with strong beer and port ; we get drunk with claret and champagne .
They would lie abominably to conceal their peccadilloes ; we lie as abominably in boasting of ours .
They stole slily in at the back-door of a bagnio ; we march in boldly at the front-door , and immediately steal out slily at the back-door .
Our mothers were prudes ; their daughters coquettes .
The first dressed like modest women , and perhaps were wantons ; the last dress like women of pleasure , and perhaps are virtuous .
Those treated without hanging out a sign ; these hang out a sign without intending to treat .
To be still more particular : the abuse of power , the views of patriots , the flattery of dependents , and the promises of great men are , I believe , pretty much the same now as in former ages .
Vices that we have no relish for , we part with for those we like ; giving up avarice for prodigality , hypocrisy for profligacy , and looseness for play . '

A correspondent , after summing up the lessons he daily extracts from trees , flowers , insects , and the inmates of his garden , continues : --
` In short , there is such a close affinity between a proper cultivation of a flower-garden and a right discipline of the mind that it is almost impossible for any thoughtful
person , that has made any proficiency in the one , to avoid paying a due attention to the other .
That industry and care which are so requisite to cleanse a garden from all sorts of weeds will naturally suggest to him how much more expedient it would be to exert the same diligence in eradicating all sorts of prejudices , follies , and vices from the mind , where they will be sure to prevail , without a great deal of care and correction , as common weeds in a neglected piece of ground .
` And as it requires more pains to extirpate some weeds than others , according as they are more firmly fixed , more numerous , or more naturalised to the soil ; so those faults will be found to be most difficult to be suppressed which have been of the largest growth and taken the deepest root , which are more predominant in number and most congenial to the constitution .

Mr. FitzAdam , defining the characters of
Siphons
and
Soakers
, points to a theory that dropsy , of which so many of their order perish , is a manifest judgment upon them , the wine they so much loved being turned into water , and themselves drowned at last in the element they so much abhorred .
' A rational and sober man , invited by the wit and gaiety of good company , and hurried away by an uncommon flow of spirits , may happen to drink too much , and perhaps accidentally to get drunk ; but then these sallies will be short and not frequent .
Whereas the soaker is an utter stranger to wit and mirth , and no friend to either .
His business is serious , and he applies himself seriously to it ; he steadily pursues the numbing , stupefying , and petrifying , not the animating and exhilarating qualities of the wine .
The more he drinks , the duller he grows ; his politics become more obscure , and his narratives more tedious and less intelligible ; till , at last
maudlin
, he employs what little articulation he has left in relating his doleful state to an insensible audience .
' I am well aware that the numerous society of
siphons
-LRB- as I
shall for the future typify the soakers , suction being equally the only business of both -RRB- will say , like Sir Tunbelly , `` What would this fellow have us do ? ''

' I heard the other day with great pleasure from my friend , Mr. Dodsley , that Mr. Johnson 's `` English Dictionary , '' with a grammar and history of our language , will be published this winter , in two large volumes in folio .
` Many people have imagined that so extensive a work would have been best performed by a number of persons , who should have taken their several departments of examining , fitting , winnowing , purifying , and finally fixing our language by incorporating their respective funds into one joint stock .
` But , whether this opinion be true or false , I think the public in general , and the republic of letters in particular , are greatly obliged to Mr. Johnson for having undertaken and executed so great and desirable a work .
Perfection is not to be expected from man ; but if we are to judge by the various works of Mr. Johnson already published , we have good reason to believe that he will bring this as near to perfection as any one man could do .
The plan of it , which we published some years ago , seems to me to be a proof of it .
Nothing can be more rationally imagined or more accurately and elegantly expressed .
I therefore recommend the previous perusal of it to all those who intend to buy the dictionary , and who , I suppose , are all those who can afford it . '

Mr. FitzAdam relates an anecdote establishing the good breeding of highwaymen of the upper class : --
` An acquaintance of mine was robbed a few years ago , and
very near shot through the head by the going off of a pistol of the accomplished Mr. M'Lean , yet the whole affair was conducted with the greatest good breeding on both sides .
The robber , who had only taken a purse
this way
because he had that morning been disappointed of marrying a great fortune , no sooner returned to his lodgings than he sent the gentleman two letters of excuses , which , with less wit than the epistles of Voltaire , had infinitely more natural and easy politeness in the turn of their expressions .
In the postscript he appointed a meeting at Tyburn , at twelve at night , where the gentleman might
purchase again
any trifles he had lost ; and my friend has been blamed for not accepting the rendezvous , as it seemed liable to be construed by ill-natured people into a doubt of the
honor
of a man who had given him all the satisfaction in his power for having unluckily been near shooting him through the head . '

` My cobbler is also a politician .
He reads the first newspapers he can get , desirous to be informed of the state of affairs in Europe , and of the street robberies of London .
He has not , I presume , analyzed the interests of the respective countries of Europe , nor deeply considered those of his own ; still less is he systematically informed of the political duties of a citizen and subject .
But his heart and his habits supply these defects .
He glows with zeal for the honor and prosperity of old England ; he will fight for it if there be an occasion , and drink to it perhaps a little too often and too much .
However , is it not to be wished that there were in this country six millions of such honest and zealous , though uninformed , citizens ?
` Our honest cobbler is thoroughly convinced , as his forefathers were for many centuries , that one Englishman can beat three Frenchmen ; and in that persuasion he would by no means
decline the trial .
Now , though in my own private opinion , deduced from physical principles , I am apt to believe that one Englishman could beat no more than two Frenchmen of equal size with himself , I should , however , be unwilling to undeceive him of that useful and sanguine error , which certainly made his countrymen triumph in the fields of Poictiers and Crecy .

` As I was musing one morning , in a most disconsolate mood , with my leg in my landlady 's lap , while she darned one of my stockings , it came into my head to collect from various books , together with my own experience and observations , plain and wholesome rules on the subject of
diet
, and then publish them in a neat pocket volume ; for I was always well inclined to do good to the world , however ungratefully it used me .
I doubt , Mr. FitzAdam , you will hardly forbear smiling to hear a man who was almost starved talk gravely of compiling observations on diet .
The moment I finished my volume I ran to an eminent bookseller near the Mansion House ; he was just set down to dinner ...
As soon as the cloth was taken away I produced my manuscript , and the bookseller put on his spectacles ; but to my no small mortification , after glancing an eye over the title-page , he looked steadfastly upon me for near a minute in a kind of amazement I could not account for , and then broke out in the following manner : -- `` My dear sir , you are come to the very worst place in the world for the sale of such a
performance
as this -- to think of expecting the Court of Aldermen 's permission to preach upon the subject of
lean and fallow abstinence
between the Royal Exchange and Temple Bar ! '' '

Extracts from a letter written by ` Priscilla Cross-stitch , ' for herself and sisters , on the subject of the indelicacy of nankin breeches , as indulged in by Patrick , their footman : --
` We give him no livery , but allow him a handsome sum yearly for clothes ; and , to
say the truth
, till within the last week he has dressed with great propriety and decency , when all at once , to our great confusion and distress , he has the assurance to appear at the sideboard in a pair of filthy nankin breeches , and those made to fit so extremely tight , that a less curious observer might have mistaken them for no breeches at all .
The shame and confusion so visible in all our faces one would think would suggest to him the odiousness of his dress ; but the fellow appears to have thrown off every appearance of decency , for at tea-table before company , as well as at meals , we are forced to endure him in this abominable nankin , our modesty conflicting with nature , to efface the idea it conveys . '
The ladies can not well discharge a good servant for this indiscretion ; their delicacy will not allow them to mention the dreadful word , nor venture on allusions to the objectionable part of the apparel ; nor will they venture to entrust the task to their maids , as it might draw them into puzzling explanations .
The publication of Priscilla 's letter , with a warning to Patrick , and a general decree against suggestive drapery , declaring it a capital offence , is intended to relieve the ladies of their confusion .

Extract from the letter of a lady , a lover of peace and quietness , on the sufferings produced by her connection with people who are fond of noise .
After describing the violence practiced in her own home , the writer continues : --
` At last I was sent to board with a distant relation , who had been captain of a man-of-war , who had given up his commission and retired into the country .
Unfortunately for poor me , the captain still retained a passion for firing a great gun , and had mounted , on a little fortification that was thrown up against the front of his house , eleven nine-pounders , which were constantly
discharged ten or a dozen times over on the arrival of visitors , and on all holidays and rejoicings .
The noise of these cannon was more terrible to me than all the rest , and would have rendered my continuance there intolerable , if a young gentleman , a relation of the captain 's , had not held me by the heart-strings , and softened by the most tender courtship in the world the horrors of these firings .

` Among the ancient Romans the great offices of state were all elective , which obliged them to be very observant of the shape of the noses of those persons to whom they were to apply for votes .
Horace tells us that a sharp nose was an indication of satirical wit and humor ; for when speaking of his friend Virgil , though he says , `` At est bonus , ut melior non alius quisquam , '' yet he allows he was no joker , and not a fit match at the sneer for those of his companions who had sharper noses than his own .
They also looked upon the short noses , with a little inflection at the end tending upwards , as a mark of the owner 's being addicted to jibing ; for the same author , talking of MÃ¦cenas , says that though he was born of an ancient family , yet was he not apt to turn persons of low birth into ridicule , which he expresses by saying that `` he had not a turn-up nose .

Martial , in one of his epigrams , calls this kind of nose the rhinocerotic nose , and says that everyone in his time affected this kind of snout , as an indication of his being

` You may have frequently observed upon the face of that useful piece of machinery , a clock , the minute and hour hands , in their revolution through the twelve divisions of the day , to be not only shifting continually from one figure to another , but to stand at times in a quite opposite direction to their former bearings , and to each other .
Now I conceive this to be pretty much the case with that complicated piece of mechanism , a modern female , or young woman of fashion : for as such I was accustomed to consider that part of the species as having no power to determine their own motions and appearances , but acted upon by the mode , and set to any point which the party who took the lead , or -LRB- to speak more properly -RRB- its regulator , pleased .
But it has so happened in the circumrotation of modes and fashions , that the present set are not only moving on continually from one pretty fancy and conceit to another , but have departed quite aside from their former principles , dividing from each other in a circumstance wherein they were always accustomed to unite , and uniting where there was ever wont to be a distinction or difference ...
The pride now is to get as far away as possible , not only from the vulgar , but from one another , and that , too , as well in the first principles of dress as in its subordinate decorations ; so that its fluctuating humor is perpetually showing itself in some new and particular sort of cap , flounce , knot , or tippet ; and every woman that you meet affects independency and to set up for herself .

many sweet creatures who were dancing . '
Everyone ` is pleased and desirous of pleasing , ' with the exception of some fashionable young men blocking up the door -- ` whose faces I remember to have seen about town , who would neither dance , drink tea , play at cards , nor speak to anyone , except now and then in whispers to a young lady , who sat in silence at the upper end of the room , in a hat and nÃ©gligÃ©e , with her back against the wall , her arms akimbo , her legs thrust out , a sneer on her lips , a scowl on her forehead , and an invincible assurance in her eyes .
Their behavior affronted most of the company , yet obtained the desired effect : for I overheard several of the country ladies say , `` It was a pity they were so proud ; for to be sure they were prodigious well-bred people , and had an immense deal of wit ; '' a mistake they could never have fallen into had these patterns of politeness condescended to have entered into any conversation .

` There was an ancient sect of philosophers , the disciples of Pythagoras , who held that the souls of men and all other animals existed in a state of perpetual transmigration , and that when by death they were dislodged from one corporeal habitation , they were immediately reinstated in another , happier or more miserable according to their behavior in the former .
This doctrine has always appeared to me to present a theory of retributory compensation which is very acceptable .
` Thus the tyrant , who by his power has oppressed his country in the situation of a prince , in that of a slave may be compelled to do it some service by his labor .
The highwayman , who has stopped
and plundered travellers , may expiate and assist them in the shape of a post-horse ; and mighty conquerors , who have laid waste the world by their swords , may be obliged , by a small alteration in sex and situation , to contribute to its re-peopling .

` Mr. FitzAdam , -- I am infested by a swarm of country cousins that are come up to town for the winter , as they call it -- a whole family of them .
They ferret me out from every place I go to , and it is impossible to stand the ridicule of being seen in their company .
` At their first coming to town I was , in a manner , obliged to gallant them to the play , where , having seated the mother with much ado , I offered my hand to the eldest of my five young cousins ; but as she was not dexterous enough to manage a great hoop with one hand only , she refused my offer , and at the first step fell along .
It was with great difficulty I got her up again ; but imagine , sir , my situation .
I sat like a mope all the night , not daring to look up for fear of catching the eyes of my acquaintance , who would have laughed me out of countenance .
` My friends see how I am mortified at all public places ; and it is a standing jest with them , wherever they meet me , to put on the appearance of the profoundest respect , and to ask , `` Pray , sir , how do your cousins do ? ''
This leads me to propose something for the relief of all those whose country cousins , like mine , expect they should introduce them into the world ; by which means we shall avoid appearing in a very ridiculous light .
I would therefore set up a person who should be known by the name of Town Usher .
His business should be to attend closely all young ladies who were never in town before , to teach them to walk into playhouses without falling over the benches , to show them the tombs and the lions , and the wax-work and the giant , and instruct them how to wonder and shut their mouths at the same time , for I really meet with so many gapers every day in the streets that I am continually yawning all the way I walk .

` Going to visit an old friend at his country seat last week , I found him at backgammon with the vicar of the parish .
My friend received me with the heartiest welcome , and introduced the doctor to my acquaintance .
This gentleman , who seemed to be about fifty , and of a florid and healthy constitution , surveyed me
all over with great attention , and , after a slight nod of the head , sat himself down without opening his mouth .
I was a little hurt at the supercilious behavior of this divine , which my friend observing , told me very pleasantly that I was rather too old to be entitled to the doctor 's complaisance , for he seldom bestowed it but upon the young and vigorous ; `` but , '' says he , `` you will know him better soon , and may probably think it worth your while to
book
him in the ` World , ' for you will find him altogether as odd a character as he is a worthy one . ''
The doctor made no reply to this raillery , but continued some time with his eye fixed upon me , and at last shaking his head , and turning to my friend , asked if he would play out the other hit .
My friend excused himself from engaging any more that evening , and ordered a bottle of wine , with pipes and tobacco , to be set on the table .
The vicar filled his pipe , and drank very cordially to my friend , still eyeing me with a seeming dislike , and neither drinking my health nor speaking a single word to me .
As I had long accustomed myself to drink nothing but water , I called for a bottle of it , and drank glass for glass with him ; which upon the doctor 's observing , he shook his head at my friend , and in a whisper , loud enough for me to hear , said , `` Poor man ! it is all over with him , I see . ''
My friend smiled , and answered , in the same audible whisper , `` No , no , doctor , Mr. FitzAdam intends to live as long as either of us . ''
He then addressed himself to me on the occurrences of the town , and drew me into a very cheerful conversation , which lasted till I withdrew to rest ; at which time the doctor rose from his chair , drank a bumper to my health , and , giving me a hearty shake by the hand , told me I was a very jolly old gentleman , and that he wished to be better acquainted with me during my stay in the country .

Whenever I attempted to draw her in a little , she tossed up her head , snorted , pranced , and gave herself such airs , that unless I let her carry me where she pleased , my limbs if not my life were in danger . '

` This enmity against dogs is pretended upon the apprehension of their going mad ; but an easier remedy might be applied , by abolishing the custom -LRB- with many others equally ingenious -RRB- of stringing bottles and stones to their tails , by which means -LRB- and in this one particular I must give up my clients -RRB- the unfortunate sufferer becomes subject to the persecutions of his own species , too apt to join the run against a brother in distress .
` But great allowance should be made for an animal who , in an intimacy of nearly six thousand years with man , has learned but one of his bad qualities . '

` Mr. FitzAdam , -- Walking up St. James 's Street the other day , I was stopt by a very smart young female , who begged my pardon for her boldness , and , looking very innocently in my face , asked me if I did not know her .
The manner of her accosting me and the extreme prettiness of her figure made me look at her with attention ; and I soon recollected that she had been a servant-girl of my wife 's , who had taken her from the country , and , after keeping her three years in her service , had dismissed her about two months ago .
`` What , Nanny , '' said I , `` is it you ?
I never saw anybody so fine in all my life ! ''
`` Oh , sir ! '' says she , with the most innocent smile imaginable , bridling her head and curtsying down to the ground , `` I have been led astray since I lived with my mistress . ''
`` Have you so , Mrs. Nanny ? '' said I ; `` and pray , child , who is it that has led you astray ? ''
`` Oh ,
sir ! '' says she , `` one of the worthiest gentlemen in the world ; and he has bought me a new nÃ©gligÃ©e for every day in the week . ''
` The girl pressed me to go and look at her lodgings , which she assured me were hard by in Bury Street , and as fine as a duchess 's ; but I declined her offer , knowing that any arguments of mine in favor of virtue and stuff gowns would avail but little against pleasure and silk nÃ©gligÃ©es .
I therefore contented myself with expressing my concern for the way of life she had entered into , and bade her farewell .
` Being a man inclined to speculate a little , as often as I think of the finery of this girl , and the reason alleged for it , I can not help fancying , whenever I fall in company with a pretty woman , dressed out beyond her visible circumstances , patched , painted , and ornamented to the extent of the mode , that she is going to make me her best curtsy , and to tell me , `` Oh , sir !
I have been led astray since I kept good company . '' '

` The trumpet sounds ; to war the troops advance ,
Adorn 'd and trim , like females to the dance
Proud of the summons , to display his might ,
The gay Lothario dresses for the fight ;
Studious in all the splendor to appear ,
Pride , pomp , and circumstance of glorious war !
His well-turn 'd limbs the diff ` rent garbs infold ,
Form 'd with nice art , and glitt ` ring all with gold ;
Across his breast the silken sash is tied ,
Behind the shoulder-knot displays its pride ;
Glitt ` ring with lace , the hat adorns his head ,
Grac 'd and distinguish 'd by the smart cockade :
Conspicuous badge ! which only heroes wear ,
Ensign of war and fav ` rite of the fair .
The graceful queue his braided tresses binds ,
And ev'ry hair in its just rank confines .
Each taper leg the snowy gaiters deck ,
And the bright gorget dandles from his neck .
Dress 'd cap-a-pie , all lovely to the sight ,
Stands the gay warrior , and expects the fight .
Rages the war ; fell slaughter stalks around ,
And stretches thousands breathless on the ground .
Down sinks Lothario , sent by one dire blow ,
A well-dress 'd hero , to the shades below .
Thus the young victim , pamper 'd and elate ,
To some resplendent fane is led in state ,
With garlands crown 'd through shouting crowds proceeds ,
And , dress 'd in fatal pomp , magnificently bleeds . '

The Last of Mr. FitzAdam .
` Before these lines can reach the press , that truly great and amiable gentleman , Mr. FitzAdam , will , in all probability , be no more .
An event so sudden and unexpected , and in which the public are so deeply interested , can not fail to excite the curiosity of every reader .
I shall , therefore , relate it in the most concise manner I am able .
` The reader may remember that in the first number of the `` World , '' and in several succeeding papers , the good old gentleman flattered himself that the profits of his labors would some time or other enable him to make a genteel figure in the world , and seat himself at last in his
one-horse chair
.
The death of Mrs. FitzAdam , which happened a few months since , as it relieved him from the great expense of housekeeping , made him in a hurry to set up his equipage ; and as the sale of his paper was even beyond his expectations , I was one of the first of his friends that advised him to purchase it .
The equipage was accordingly bespoke and sent home ; and as he had all along promised that his first visit in it should be to me , I expected him last Tuesday at my country-house at Hoxton .
The poor gentleman was punctual to his appointment ; and it was with great delight that I saw him from my window driving up the road that leads to my house .
Unfortunately for him , his eye caught mine ; and hoping -LRB- as I suppose -RRB- to captivate me by his great skill in driving , he made two or three flourishes with his whip , which so frightened the horse that he ran furiously away with the carriage , dashed it against a post , and threw the driver from his seat with a violence hardly to be conceived .
I screamed out to my maid , `` Lord bless me ! '' says I , `` Mr. FitzAdam is killed ! '' and away we ran to the spot where he lay .
At first I imagined that his head was off , but upon drawing nearer I found it was his hat !
He breathed , indeed , which gave me hopes that he was not quite dead ; but for signs of life , he had positively none .
