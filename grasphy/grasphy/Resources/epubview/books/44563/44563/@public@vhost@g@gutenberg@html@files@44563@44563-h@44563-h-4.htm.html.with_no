</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_30">The Weimar reminiscences show how early Thackeray's passion for art had developed itself.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_31">One who knew him well affirms that he was originally intended for the Bar; but he had, indeed, already determined to be an artist, and for a considerable period he diligently followed his bent.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_32">He visited Rome, where he stayed some time, and subsequently, as we shall see, settled for some time in Paris, 'where,' says a writer in the 'Edinburgh Review' for January 1848, 'we well remember, ten or twelve years ago, finding him, day after day, engaged in copying pictures in the Louvre, in order to qualify himself for his intended profession.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_33">It may be doubted, however,' adds this writer, 'whether any degree of assiduity would have enabled him to excel in the money-making branches, for his talent was altogether of the Hogarth kind, and was principally remarkable in the pen-and-ink sketches of character and situation which he dashed off for the amusement of his friends.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_34">This is just criticism; but Thackeray, though caring little himself for the graces of good drawing or correct anatomy, had a keen appreciation of the beauties of contemporary artists.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_35">Years after—in 1848—when, as he says, the revolutionary storm which raged in France 'drove many peaceful artists, as well as kings, ministers, tribunes, and socialists of state for refuge to our country,' an artist friend of his early Paris life found his way to Thackeray's home in London.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_36">This was Monsieur Louis Marvy, in whose</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_37">atelier</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_38">the former had</span>
<a id="Page_115" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="115">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_39">passed many happy hours with the family of the French artist—in that constant cheerfulness and sunshine, as his English friend expressed it, which the Parisian was now obliged to exchange for a dingy parlour and the fog and solitude of London.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_40">A fine and skilful landscape-painter himself, M. Marvy, while here, as a means of earning a living, made a series of engravings after the works of our English landscape-painters.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_41">For some of these his friend obtained for M. Marvy permission to take copies in the valuable private collection of Mr. Thomas Baring.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_42">The publishers, however, would not undertake the work without a series of letter-press notices of each picture from Mr. Thackeray; and the latter accordingly added some criticisms which are interesting as developing his theory of this kind of art.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_43">The artists whose works are engraved are Calcott, Turner, Holland, Danby, Creswick, Collins, Redgrave, Lee, Cattermole, W. J. Müller, Harding, Nasmyth, Wilson, E. W. Cooke, Constable, De Wint, and Gainsborough.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_44">It was, we believe, in 1834, and while residing for a short period in Albion Street, Hyde Park, the residence of his mother and her second husband, Major Carmichael Smyth, that Mr. Thackeray began his literary career as a contributor to 'Fraser's</span>
<a id="Page_116" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="116">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_45">Magazine.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_46">The pseudonyms of 'Michael Angelo Titmarsh,' 'Fitz Boodle,' 'Yellowplush,' or 'Lancelot Wagstaff,' under which he afterwards amused the readers of the periodicals, had not then been thought of.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_47">His early papers related chiefly to the Fine Arts; but most of them had some reference to his French experiences.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_48">He seems to have had a peculiar fancy for Paris, where he resided, with brief intervals, for some years after coming of age, and where most of his magazine papers were written.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_64">One of Thackeray's literary associates has given some amusing particulars of his Paris life, and his subsequent interest in the city, where he had many friends and was known to a wide circle of readers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_65">'He lived,' says this writer, 'in Paris "over the water," and it is not long since, in strolling about the Latin Quarter with the best of companions, that we visited his lodgings, Thackeray inquiring after those who were already forgotten—unknown.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_66">Those who may wish to learn his early Parisian life and associations should turn to the story of "Philip on his Way through the World."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_67">Many incidents in that narrative are reminiscences of his own youthful literary struggles whilst living modestly in this city.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_68">Latterly, fortune and fame enabled the author of "Vanity Fair" to visit imperial Paris in imperial style, and Mr. Thackeray put up generally at the Hôtel de Bristol, in the Place Vendôme.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_69">Never was increase of fortune more gracefully worn or more generously employed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_70">The struggling artist and small man of letters, whom he was sure to find at home or abroad, was pretty safe to</span>
<a id="Page_119" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="119">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_71">be assisted if he learned their wants.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_72">I know of many a kind act.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_73">One morning, on entering Mr. Thackeray's bedroom in Paris, I found him placing some napoleons in a pill-box, on the lid of which was written, "One to be taken occasionally."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_74">"What are you doing?" said I.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_75">"Well," he replied, "there is an old person here who says she is very ill and in distress, and I strongly suspect that this is the sort of medicine she wants.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_76">Dr. Thackeray intends to leave it with her himself.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_84">Thackeray's affection for Paris, however, appears to have been founded upon no relish for the gaieties of the French metropolis, and certainly not upon any liking for French institutions.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_85">His papers on this subject are generally criticisms upon political,</span>
<a id="Page_120" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="120">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_86">social, and literary failings of the French, written in a severe spirit which savours more of the confident judgment of youth than of the calm spirit of the citizen of the world.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_87">The reactionary rule of Louis Philippe, the Government of July, and the boasted Charter of 1830, were the objects of his especial dislike; nor was he less unsparing in his views of French morals as exemplified in their law courts, and in the novels of such writers as Madame Dudevant.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_88">The truth is, that at this Period Paris was, in the eyes of the art-student,</span>
<a id="Page_121" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="121">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_89">simply the Paradise of young painters.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_93">off for some English or foreign paper his enthusiastic notices of the Paris Exhibition, or a criticism on French writers, or a story of French artist life, or an account of some great</span>

</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_95">then stirring the Parisian world.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_96">This was doubtless the happiest period of his life.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_97">In one of these papers he describes minutely the life of the art student in Paris, and records his impressions of it at the time.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_100">The painter's trade in France, he discovers, is a good one; it is more appreciated, respected, and even more liberally patronised than with us.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_101">While in England there is no school but the 'Academy' open to the young student—in those days South Kensington did not exist, and our artists are not accustomed to grant young beginners admission to their studios at pleasure, as has long been the practice abroad—in France excellent schools abound, where, under the eye of a practised master, a young man can learn the rudiments of his art for about ten pounds a year, including all kinds of accessory instruction, models,</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_102">c.; while he can, out of doors, obtain all sorts of incentives to study for 'just nothing at all.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_103">The life of the young artist in France, we are told, is the</span>
<a id="Page_123" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="123">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_104">merriest, most slovenly existence possible.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_105">He comes to Paris with some forty pounds a year settled on him to keep him and pay all his expenses.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_106">He lives in a quarter where all his surroundings are of the same order—art and artists; from morning till night, he is in an atmosphere of painting; he arrives at his</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_108">very early, and often gains a good day's study before the doors of our Academy are unbolted.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_110">It is certain that Thackeray had developed a talent for writing long before he had abandoned his intention of becoming a painter, and that he became a contributor to magazines at a time when there was at least no necessity for his earning a livelihood by his pen.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_111">It is probable, therefore, that it was his success in the literary art, rather than his failure, as has been assumed, in acquiring skill as a painter, which gradually drew him into that career of authorship, the pecuniary profits of which became afterwards more important to him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_116">Before proceeding to the well-known productions from the pen of our great novelist, which are familiar enough to all, it may interest the reader to glance at his juvenile efforts in literature and art.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_117">It will be found that we dwell more minutely upon the consideration of these early sketches than is absolutely warranted by their importance in comparison with his great works; but we are tempted to enlarge on the papers which illustrate the outset of the author's career, under the conviction that they are but little known to the majority of his admirers.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_118">We have already noticed Thackeray's characteristic hand in the</span>
<a id="Page_125" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="125">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_119">pages of 'The Snob,' where his native skill in parody was first evidenced in print.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_120">We have incidentally cited the satirical force of his observant powers at the age of twenty and during his residence in Germany; though, it must be confessed, these early impressions may owe much of their strength to the training he had gone through during the interval between the time he actually spent in the scenes described, and the period at which the sketches were first given to the public.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_121">From the date of its establishment the columns of 'Fraser' abound in sly satires directed against the school of fiction which then happened to find favour with the romance-reading public.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_122">Ainsworth and Bulwer had made daring experiments with new and startling materials for exciting the imagination of their believers; and the encouragement held out by the unequivocal success of the unwholesome order of novels was sufficient to excite the wrath of those writers and critics who strove to lead the popular taste back to healthier literature.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_123">Thackeray's keen appreciation of the genuine humour of Fielding, Scott, and similar authors, who founded the interest of their stories on such sounder principles as were dictated by intelligent study of human nature, and who mainly relied for their incidents on the probable occurrences, the actions and passions, of actual life, was sufficient to qualify him as a subtle opponent of the unnatural style; and he appears to have early enlisted his pen on the side of the Fraserians, who were, perhaps, the bitterest antagonists which the apostles of these unlikely anomalies were fated to encounter in the development of their novel theories.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_124">In the August and September numbers of 'Fraser' for 1832 appeared the forerunner of those burlesque romances for which Thackeray's name became afterwards famous.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_125">The sketch was published when the budding satirist was little over twenty-one years of age; and the just and scarifying criticism which it contains is sufficiently remarkable in so youthful a writer.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_126">But there is the strongest internal evidence that the travestie of 'Elizabeth Brownrigge: a Tale,' proceeds from the author who afterwards narrated the 'Story of Catharine;' who interrupted the early chapters of 'Vanity Fair' to introduce certain felicitous parodies; and who, in the pages of 'Punch,' produced the irresistible series of 'Prize Novelists' which remain unsurpassed.</span>
<a id="Page_126" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="126">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_127">'Elizabeth Brownrigge' was dedicated to the author of 'Eugene Aram;' and its writer described himself as a young man who had for a length of time applied himself to literature, but had hitherto entirely failed to derive any emolument from his exertions.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_128">His tragedies, comedies, operas and farces, his novels, poems, and romances, had already accumulated into an alarming pile of unacceptable and unprofitable MSS.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_129">On examining the grounds of their refusal, he was surprised to find one identical phrase occurring in every letter rejecting his talented productions: the poems are all pronounced 'classical, pure in taste, and perfect in diction;' the novels are acknowledged to be 'just in character, interesting in plot, pathetic, unexceptionable in sentiment;' but unhappily they have all one glaring defect in common—they are '</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_130">not of a popular description</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_131">.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_132">Enlightened by the reflection that those who write to live must write to please, he determined to master the popular taste; the otherwise faultless papers were put by until fashions should change in the reading world; and his laundress was sent to the circulating library for the last most popular novel—the author, disappointed but not discouraged, being resolved to study its style and manner, investigate the principles on which it was written, to imbibe its spirit, and to compose his next new work as nearly as possible upon the same model.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_133">The popular novel brought was 'Eugene Aram.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_134">From its pages the hitherto unsuccessful writer caught a complete solution of the errors and defects of his former productions.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_135">From the frequent perusal of older works of imagination, he had learned the unfashionable practice of endeavouring so to weave the incidents of his stories as to interest his readers in favour of virtue and to increase their detestation of vice.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_136">By the study of 'Eugene Aram' he was taught to mix vice and virtue up together in such an inextricable confusion as to render it impossible that any preference should be given to either, or that one, indeed, should be at all distinguishable from the other.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_143">'In "Elizabeth Brownrigge" it will be the author's sole ambition to impart to his efforts some portion of the intense interest that distinguishes the works of Mr. Bulwer, and to acquire the fame which the skilful imitation of so great a master may hope to receive from the generosity of an enlightened and delighted public.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_144">In taking his subject from that walk of life to which "Eugene Aram" had directed his attention, many motives conspired to fix the writer's choice on the heroine of the ensuing tale: she is a classic personage—her name has been already "linked to immortal verse" by the muse of Canning.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_145">Besides, it is extraordinary that, as Mr. Bulwer had commenced a tragedy under the title of "Eugene Aram," the dedicator had already sketched a burletta with the title of "Elizabeth Brownrigge."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_146">In his dramatic piece he had indeed been guilty of an egregious and unpardonable error: he had attempted to excite the sympathies of his audience in favour of the murdered apprentices; but the study of Mr. Bulwer disabused him of so vulgar a prejudice, and, in the present version of her case, all the interest of the reader and all the pathetic powers of the author will be engaged on the side of the murderess.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_147">He has taken a few slight liberties with the story, but such alterations have the sanction of Bulwer's example and the recommendation of his authority.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_148">As he has omitted any mention of the wife of his Eugene, his imitator has not thought it necessary to recall the reader's attention to the husband and sixteen children of his Elizabeth.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_149">As the hero of "Eugene Aram" is endowed with more learning and virtue than he possessed, and is converted from the usher of a grammar school at Hayes into the solitary student of a lone and romantic tower in a distant county; the author of "Elizabeth" presumed to raise the situation of his heroine, and, instead of portraying her as the wife of a saddler in Fleur-de-lis Court, and midwife of the poor-house, he has represented her in his tale as a young gentlewoman of independent fortune, a paragon of beauty, a severe and learned moral philosopher, and the Lady Bountiful of the village of Islington.'</span>

</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_159">According to a richly worked out principle of opposites, this droll conception proceeds with incidents and even names taken directly from the 'Newgate Calendar,' but rivalling 'Eugene Aram' itself in magnificence of diction, absurdity of sentiment, and pomp of Greek quotation.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_160">The trial scene and Elizabeth's speech in her own defence abound in clever points—indeed, the humour of the whole composition is original and striking; although the later burlesques from presumably the same hand have made us familiar with similar features brought to maturity.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_161">During the intervals of his residence in London—for Paris may be considered to have been almost his head-quarters at this period—Thackeray had made the acquaintance of most of the brilliant writers and rising artists of the day.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_162">It is certain that before he became popularly known as a contributor to 'Fraser,' where his papers contributed in no inconsiderable degree to the success of the magazine, he was concerned in more than one literary venture.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_163">Between 1832 and 1834 appeared a small miscellany, the 'Comic Magazine,' now tolerably obscure: in its duodecimo pages may be found the writings of several authors whose names have since become famous.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_164">It was profusely illustrated: the major part of the cuts, some of them of particular excellence, were by the hand of the gifted and unfortunate Seymour.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_165">It seems that Thackeray was to some extent interested in this publication, to which he probably supplied both drawings and verses; although, at this date, it is difficult to distinguish his individual contributions, especially as they happen to be less characteristic than the average of his works; the cuts, although full of fun, having suffered from the necessity of reducing the cost of engraving, as the expenses of the publication became onerous.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_166">There existed in 1833 a critical journal, 'devoted to literature, science, music, theatricals, and the fine arts,' rejoicing in the slightly high-flown title of the 'National Standard:' it was one of the early enterprises in the way of cheap publication, and, in spite of its name, conscientiously aimed at supplying a want that has never yet been adequately filled up—namely, the circulation of</span>
<a id="Page_129" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="129">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_167">sterling independent criticism.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_168">We are not informed how Thackeray first became interested in this publication, but, from the hints thrown out in his later writings, it seems that he was induced to become, in some part, proprietor of the venture.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_169">In his sketch of 'Mr. Adolphus Simcoe,' who is introduced into the pages of 'Punch' (1842) as a typical ex-owner of a miscellany, the 'Lady's Lute,' which came to a disastrous end, we are informed that, presuming a person of literary tastes should, from some unfortunate combination of circumstances, conceive a passion to become the editor of a magazine, to assemble about him 'the great spirits of the age,' and to be able to communicate his own contributions direct to the public, a paper is sure to be for sale—'indeed, if a gentleman has a mind to part with his money, it is very hard if he cannot find some periodical with a broom at its mast-head.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_170">In the eighteenth number of the 'National Standard' (May 4) we recognise Thackeray's pencil in a very fair cut of Louis Philippe—quite in the style of his contributions to 'Punch' some ten years later.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_171">The likeness is undoubtedly good and characteristic.</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_172">Le roi des Français</span>

</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_174">In his beaver he sports the tricolor badge, 'like an overgrown pancake,' as the verses below declare.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_305">It is presumable that the Paris correspondent did not abandon his paper; he sends more cuts, and foreign letters from all parts, full of the most interesting private intelligence; and notably one from 'Constantinople,' supplying an imaginative gossiping exposure of all the complicated intrigues discernible to those who may be behind the scenes at the Porte; and last, but by no means least, he sends them one of the capital stories which he afterwards reprinted, with fresh illustrations, in the 'Paris Sketch Book,'—even the 'Devil's Wager,' with a strikingly original sketch of Sir Rollo in his desperate travels to redeem his soul, borne through the clouds with, for greater security, the tail of Mercurius unpleasantly curled round the apoplectic throttle of his deceased highness the late Count of Chauchigny,</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_308">The moral of this veracious</span>
<a id="Page_136" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="136">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_309">tale was promised 'in several successive numbers;' but the wonderful story and its excellent illustration, superior we fancy to those in the collected series, were ineffectual to establish the success of the 'National Standard,' on which they were partially thrown away.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_310">A flourishing and facetious leader, in the thirty-sixth number, placed the circulation at the astonishing figures of 84,715; and particularly advertised that the price, in spite of the unprecedented arrangements that had been perfected for rendering their paper the leading feature of the age, would continue 'only twopence.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_311">A few numbers later it was confessed that the journal would henceforth appear at threepence, as it was found impossible to successfully carry out all their great programme of improvements at a lesser price.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_312">Thackeray's contributions after this are either missing, or his spirits were possibly dashed by the pecuniary responsibilities of the undertaking.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_313">After a time the 'National Standard' was forced to haul down its colours: it lasted from January 5, 1833, to February 1, 1834, when it not improbably left a neat train of liabilities for at least one of its contributaries to discharge.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_314">It is certain that its failure entailed disagreeable consequences.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_315">We all remember that Mr. Adolphus Simcoe's little fortune went down in the 'Lady's Lute,' while its versatile proprietor completed his misery in Her Majesty's Asylum of the Fleet.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_316">Still fresher must it be in the minds of Thackeray's readers, that the narrator of 'Lovel the Widower,' in the character of Mr. Batchelor, relates how, having these same literary aspirations, and a certain command of ready money withal, he too was persuaded that to be part proprietor of a periodical was rather a fine thing.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_317">It may not be forgotten that in his first venture, coming to London, blushing with his college experiences, he had emulated the bargain of Moses Primrose, and the memorable gross of spectacles in shagreen cases.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_318">A college acquaintance, with a smooth tongue, and sleek, sanctified exterior, and a queer bill-discounter (no one indeed but our old friends, the Rev. C. Honeyman, M.A., and Mr. Sherrick, wine-merchant,</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_319">c., to whom we were early introduced in the 'Newcomes'), had somehow got hold of that neat literary paper the 'Museum,' of which eligible property this innocent gentleman became the purchaser.</span>
<a id="Page_137" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="137">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_320">The failure of the 'National Standard and Literary Representative' seems for a time to have damped Thackeray's enthusiasm so far as fresh adventures on his own account were concerned; but in the March of 1836 his first attempt at independent authorship appeared simultaneously in London and Paris.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_321">'This publication,' it was observed in the 'North British Review,' shortly after the humourist's death, 'at the time when he still hoped to make his bread by art, is, like indeed everything he either said or did, perfectly characteristic;' and it has been so utterly forgotten that we are encouraged to describe the plates</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_322">seriatim</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_323">.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_324">We may add that it was published in Paris by Ritter and Goupil, and by Mitchell in London; though it is now so scarce that we were unsuccessful in tracing a copy in the Catalogue of the British Museum.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_325">It is a small folio, in a tinted wrapper, and consists of nine subjects in all, which are printed on India paper.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_326">Like all Thackeray's satires, his fun is directed to a purpose; and by the very realism of his pencil he successfully turns to ridicule one of his pet aversions—the dancing man, so frequently assailed in his writings.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_327">The series bears the title of 'Flore et Zephyr, Ballet Mythologique, par Théophile Wagstaff,' and is dedicated to Flora, who herself figures in place of her name upon the cover.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_328">In a rose-bedizened stage bower, where the foliage is evidently cut out by the stage-carpenter, stands the exquisite</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_329">première danseuse</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_330">, looking as ancient, self-satisfied, and repulsive as some of these heroines occasionally appear.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_331">She is all alone in the centre of the stage, but the old faded smirk and the eyelids modestly drooped express her consciousness that she is the object of attraction to a full house.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_332">Her fascinating smile is tempered with the air of bashful modesty, conveyed by crossing her bony and sinewy arms and large hands upon her lean chest; her throat is particularly camel-like, and the muscles are unmistakably prominent; her nose is long, and has a pendulous droop, which divides, by its shadow, her ample semicircular mouth, and gives an effect of sentimental absurdity; a blonde wreath of ample dimensions and indefinite design surrounds her raven locks; a few straggling hairs are in places plastered on her forehead in unpremeditated love-locks; her dress, of simple uncreased muslin, stands out like a white</span>
<a id="Page_138" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="138">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_333">tulip, and is carelessly girt by a wreath of flowers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_334">Beneath the skirts appear her professional legs, arranged of course in an attitude perfectly at variance with nature or grace, the heels touching, and the long white feet pointing to precisely opposite poles of the compass.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_335">In maiden meditation, she is sighing for her Zephyr before some thousand eyes, the focus of all the double-barrelled lorgnettes in the theatre.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_336">In the following plate,</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_337">La Danse fait ses offrandes sur l'autel de l'Harmonie</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_338">, the faithful Zephyr has come to rejoin his Flora; and the happy pair trip down the footlights, set smiles on their faces, with gracious gestures of salutation, to propitiate the unseen but perfectly understood 'house.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_339">As to the Altar of Harmony, their backs are turned on the supposed object of their offerings—represented by a pile of musical instruments mounted on a pillar, and topped by a laurel-wreathed fiddle, the expression of which ('the face of a fiddle') wears a dreary resemblance to a dolefully-long human countenance.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_340">Zephyr is as remarkable as his fair companion: his face is, if possible, more faded, his smile more set and weary; you feel that his perpetual grin is the grimmest sight in the world, and that no effort of his livid face could express a natural smile.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_341">He too sports a huge pair of impossibly arched eyebrows, beneath which the heavy lids droop with a worn-out look which is certainly unaffected.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_342">His wig, you recognise, is no part of himself, although much of his expression is conferred by it: it is a tremendous erection, of obviously artificial construction, and sufficiently portentous to make its</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_343">début</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_344">alone.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_345">This gentleman's nose is large and pear-shaped; his mouth and lips large and coarse; and his Hebrew descent is sufficiently characterised.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_346">He is clad in a simple tunic; his naked arms are strongly developed and ugly; his legs are large, and the muscles stand out with the prominence observable in members of his profession: his shoulders, of course, are tipped with gauzy wings.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_347">The third plate,</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_348">Jeux innocens de Zéphyr et Flore</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_349">, introduces us to the altar of Cupid—a sweet little deity in plaster, who is drawing his stringless bow, and aiming an imaginary arrow (the shaft is wanting) at the tripping and artless Flora, who, with outstretched hands, is guarding her tender bosom; meanwhile it is only pantomimically she is conscious of Cupid's aims; her eyes are riveted on the audience.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_350">Zephyr is ogling up behind the</span>
<a id="Page_139" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="139">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_351">altar, his frightful smile more set than ever, his wig more independent of himself, his graces more fantastic; he is advancing, with one foot pointed about a yard or so in advance of its fellow, anxious to bind the fair sharer in these simple diversions in a wreath of stage-flowers.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_352">In the next plate</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_353">Flora is deploring the absence of her Zephyr</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_354">, who has left her an opportunity to execute a</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_355">pas seul</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_356">.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_357">We are presented with the back of the engaging</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_358">coryphée</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_359">: she is balanced on one foot; the left is raised at an angle of considerably over forty-five degrees—a touching and perfectly natural method of expressing her disconsolate situation.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_360">In this drawing we are favoured with a view of the front of the 'house;' the faces of the men in the orchestra are treated expressively.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_361">One musician's eye is peculiarly roguish, while another performer is endeavouring to combine business with pleasure; to play his flageolet, follow his score, and yet not lose sight of the deploring one.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_362">Zephyr's turn for individual display occurs in the next plate.</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_363">Dans un pas seul il exprime son extrême désespoir</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_364">; and accordingly, without in any degree altering the cast of the mask of a face he wears, he proceeds to express the intensity of his desolation, by convincing the audience of the strength and activity of his lower members, in a succession of horizontal bounds which give him the aspect of a flying man.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_365">In the corner of the picture a Cupid—a plump-faced little boy, decked out as Cupid—and his elder sister (the likeness between the pair is evidently intentional) are opening their eyes and mouths with stupid astonishment at Zephyr's grief-inspired agility.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_366">Fresh actresses arrive on the scene.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_367">Zephyr has struck a stage attitude expressing the unconsolable state of his affections; his legs crossed, and one arm resting on the now vacant pedestal.</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_368">Triste et abattu, les séductions des Nymphes le tentent en vain.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_369">The ladies of the ballet flit vainly around him, his eyes are cast down; even the fascinations which are held out by a clumsy theatrical lyre, held in a melting</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_370">pose</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_371">by one fair creature reposing on one knee, are insufficient to tempt him to forget the charms of the absent.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_372">Such fidelity can be only recompensed by the '</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_373">Reconciliation of Flora and Zephyr</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_374">,' which is displayed in the succeeding plate.</span>
<a id="Page_140" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="140">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_375">The triumphant Zephyr, his smile, if possible, expressing less meaning than usual, is now kneeling; his arms are folded, and his head is supported at an angle by a rigid throat—for he has a weight to sustain.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_376">The faithful Flora has bounded into his arms; and, in the picture, the last triumphant tableau is before the audience.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_377">One foot of the</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_378">danseuse</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_379">lightly rests on Zephyr's outstretched thigh, the other is on a level with her shoulder; her arms are gracefully clasped around her companion, to preserve her balance, and her head and throat are also at a studied angle, for the sake of the equilibrium of the group.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_380">On this rapturous scene of fidelity rewarded with boundless happiness the curtain descends; but we have not seen the last of the performers.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_381">In, presumably, the Green Room we witness '</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_382">The Retreat of Flora</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_383">.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_384">The fair creature, who is in every way decidedly French, is there with her mother and two admirers: Zephyr, of course, does not figure in this category.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_385">The two latter pictures of the series are in Thackeray's most forcible style; and indeed, for truth, expressiveness, and character, compare quite favourably with Hogarth's finer satires.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_386">One lover is a young dandy of the period: his intellectual capacities are conspicuously absent; it may be said he has neither forehead nor chin.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_387">He is sitting imbecilely astride his chair, vacantly leaning his elbows on the back, and gazing at nothing in particular; he is probably a trifle vexed at Flora's indifference, or is jealous of his elder rival.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_388">The smiles and leers of Flora's mamma are thrown away at present: the old lady is no less painted, and is possibly more artificially made up than her daughter; her eyebrows owe much to art, her cheeks are evidently high in colour, her faded smirks and glittering eyes are by no means inviting, and a band of velvet across her forehead suggests a suspicion of 'false fronts;' her bonnet is of the gaudiest, a very pinnacle of bows, ribands, and artificial flowers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_389">This venerable creature is heavily cloaked, and carries a huge muff, having evidently walked to the theatre to rejoin her fair darling, who is standing on the hearth-rug, her toes still attitudinising; she is slightly wrapped in a shawl, ready for her</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_390">fiacre</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_391">.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_392">The gentleman on whom Flora is smiling, and evidently at something just a little wicked, is a big, burly, coarse, self-satisfied, elderly man, whose hands are in the pockets of his awkward straddling trousers: his face is a study of downright unflinching</span>
<a id="Page_141" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="141">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_393">grinning baseness; he is probably doing a good business on the Bourse, and his wife and family are no doubt at home in their beds.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_394">The last plate, '</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_395">Les Délassements de Zéphyr</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_396">,' is perhaps the most refreshing to contemplate; for in it we see labour rejoicing over those little comforts which are its reward.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_397">Poor old Zephyr, who is after all a very homely, estimable, and hard-worked personage, who probably gives lessons, drills the</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_398">ballet</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_399">all day, and capers without intermission till midnight all the year round, is resting his arm on the chimney-piece, whereon his attitude is still a set</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_400">pose</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_401">: the preposterous wig is in the hands of the</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_402">perruquier</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_403">, a nobly curled barber, who, as he brushes the monstrous</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_404">toupée</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_405">, is complacently admiring what</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_406">he</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_407">evidently considers a triumph of art.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_408">Zephyr, we can now realise, is of no particular age, or race; he retains his jaded old sprightliness as he favours his capacious nose with a copious pinch of snuff, supplied to that organ from the ball of his thumb, with much apparent gratification.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_409">The gentleman who is offering this hero the courtesy of his huge snuff-box is a jolly, jaunty-looking person enough, a compound of splendour and shabbiness; probably himself attached to one of the theatres as low comedian.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_410">His jowl beams with good temper, and is ensconced in a pair of huge gills and a voluminous neckcloth; his hat and waistcoat are showy of their kind; his greatcoat has evidently suffered by wear, though still an imposing and comfortable garment.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_411">The impression of his respectability becomes fainter below; his trousers and boots are evidently out of shape and unequivocally seedy, and his old umbrella is a study of itself.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_412">An innocent-faced chubby pot-boy, with a smile of recognition for the visitor, is holding, on a tray from the nearest tavern, a foaming pot of porter for Zephyr after his saltatory exertions, and a glass of brandy-and-water to revive his friend, who has come in from the cold.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_413">These drawings, which are certainly equal to anything Thackeray has produced, have been drawn on stone by Edward Morton, son of 'Speed the Plough,' who has, if anything, contributed to their excellence: they are remarkably well-executed examples of lithography, and are delineated with that delicate strength, truth, and thoughtful effect for which the works of this able but little-known artist are always to be praised.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_414">Each plate bears the</span>
<a id="Page_142" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="142">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_415">monogram WT, which, with the M added, afterwards became tolerably familiar to the world.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_416">It is worthy of remark that in this, as always, Thackeray ridicules the ugly and the absurd without departing from truth, or trenching on impropriety.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_417">The quality he praised highest in Cruikshank and Leech—that of never raising a blush or offending modesty—is perhaps most remarkable in himself, in treating a subject like</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_418">Flora and Zephyr</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_419">, where a young artist, and especially one whose training had been in Paris, might be tempted to imply a certain freedom of manners.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_420">'The effect of looking over these</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_421">juvenilia</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_422">, these shafts from a mighty bow, is good, is moral; you are sorry for the hard-wrought slaves; perhaps a little contemptuous towards the idle people who go to see them.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_423">Thackeray had scarcely attained the age of three-and-twenty when the young literary art-student in Paris was recognised as an established contributor to 'Fraser,' worthy to take a permanent place among the brilliant staff which then rendered this periodical famous both in England and on the Continent.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_424">It was at that time under the editorship of the celebrated Maginn, one of the last of those compounds of genius and profound scholarship with reckless extravagance and loose morals, who once flourished under the encouragement of a tolerant public opinion.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_425">There can be no doubt that the editor and Greek scholar who is always in difficulties, who figures in several of his works, is a faithful picture of this remarkable man as he appeared to his young contributor.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_426">His friend, the late Mr. Hannay, says:—</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_427">'Certain it is that he lent—or in plainer English, gave—five hundred pounds to poor old Maginn when he was beaten in the battle of life, and like other beaten soldiers made a prisoner—in the Fleet.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_428">With the generation going out—that of Lamb and Coleridge—he had, we believe, no personal acquaintance.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_429">Sydney Smith he met at a later time; and he remembered with satisfaction that something which he wrote about Hood gave pleasure to that delicate humorist and poet in his last days.</span>
<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@44563@44563-h@44563-h-19.htm.html#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor pginternal" id="FNanchor_7">
<span id="SENTENCE_430">[7]</span>
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_431">Thackeray's earliest literary friends were certainly found among the</span>
<a id="Page_143" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="143">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_432">brilliant band of Fraserians, of whom Thomas Carlyle, always one of his most appreciative admirers, is probably the solitary survivor.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_433">From reminiscences of the wilder lights in the "Fraser" constellation were drawn the pictures of the queer fellows connected with literature in "Pendennis"—Captain Shandon, the ferocious Bludyer, stout old Tom Serjeant, and so forth.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_434">Magazines in those days were more brilliant than they are now, when they are haunted by the fear of shocking the Fogy element in their circulation; and the effect of their greater freedom is seen in the buoyant, riant, and unrestrained comedy of Thackeray's own earlier "Fraser" articles.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_435">"I suppose we all begin by being too savage," is the phrase of a letter he wrote in 1849; "</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_436">I know one who did.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_437">" He was alluding here to the "Yellowplush Papers" in particular, where living men were very freely handled.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_438">This old, wild satiric spirit it was which made him interrupt even the early chapters of "Vanity Fair," by introducing a parody which he could not resist of some contemporary novelist.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_439">[8]</span>
</a>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_440">But we have a proof of the fact of how fully he was recognised by his brother Fraserians as one of themselves, in Maclise's picture of the contributors, prefixed to the number of 'Frasers Magazine' for January 1835—a picture which must have been drawn at some period in the previous year.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_441">This outline cartoon represents a banquet at the house of the publisher, Mr. Fraser, at which, on some of his brief visits to London, Thackeray had doubtless been present, for it is easy to trace in the juvenile features of the tall figure with the double eyeglass—Thackeray was throughout life somewhat near-sighted—a portrait of the future author of 'Vanity Fair.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_442">Mr. Mahony, the well-known 'Father Prout' of the magazine, in his account of this picture, written in 1859, tells us that the banquet was no fiction.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_443">In the chair appears Dr. Maginn in the act of making a speech; and around him are a host of contributors, including Bryan Waller Procter (better known then as Barry Cornwall), Robert Southey, William Harrison Ainsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, James Hogg, John Galt, Fraser the publisher, having on his right, Crofton Croker, Lockhart, Theodore Hook, Sir David Brewster, Thomas Carlyle, Sir Egerton Brydges, Rev.
