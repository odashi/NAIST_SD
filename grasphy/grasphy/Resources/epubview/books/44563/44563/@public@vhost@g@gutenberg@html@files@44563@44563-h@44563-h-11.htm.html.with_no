<span id="SENTENCE_6">Words and money are both to be regarded as only marks of things; and as the knowledge of the one, so the possession of the other is of no use, unless directed to a farther end.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_7">A mutual commerce could not be carried on among men, if some common standard had not been agreed upon, to which the value of all the various productions of art and nature were reducible, and which might be of the same use in the conveyance of property as words are in that of ideas.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_8">Gold, by its beauty, scarceness, and durable nature, seems designed by Providence to a purpose so excellent and advantageous to mankind.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_9">Upon these considerations that metal came first into esteem.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_10">But such who cannot see beyond what is nearest in the pursuit, beholding mankind touched with an affection for gold, and being ignorant of the true reason that introduced this odd passion into human nature, imagine some intrinsic worth in the metal to be the cause of it.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_25">'There is a silly habit among many of our minor orators, who display their eloquence in the several coffee-houses of this fair city, to the no small annoyance of considerable numbers of her Majesty's spruce and loving subjects, and that is, a humour they have got of twisting off your buttons.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_26">These ingenious gentlemen are not able to advance three words till they have got fast hold of one of your buttons; but as soon as they have procured such an excellent handle for discourse, they will indeed proceed with great elocution.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_27">I know not how well some may have escaped; but for my part, I have often met with them to my cost; having, I believe, within these three years last past, been argued out of several dozen; insomuch that I have for some time ordered my tailor to bring me home with every suit a dozen at least of spare ones, to supply the place of such as, from time to time, are detached as a help to discourse, by the vehement gentlemen before mentioned.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_28">In the coffee-houses here about the Temple, you may harangue even among our dabblers in politics for about two buttons a-day, and many times for less.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_29">I had yesterday the good fortune to receive very considerable additions to my knowledge in state affairs; and I find this morning that it has not stood me in above a button.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_76">It is reckoned an excellent piece of workmanship, and was designed by a great hand in imitation of the antique Egyptian lion, the face of it being compounded out of that of a lion and a wizard.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_83">I shall not suffer him to worry any man's reputation; nor indeed fall on any person whatsoever, such only excepted as disgrace the name of this generous animal, and under the title of lions contrive the ruin of their fellow-subjects.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_84">Those who read the history of the Popes, observe that the Leos have been the best and the Innocents the worst of that species; and I hope I shall not be thought to derogate from my lion's character, by representing him as such a peaceable, good-natured, well-designing beast.'</span>

</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_169">'"The name of Helim is still famous through all the Eastern parts of the world.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_170">He was the Governor of the Black Palace, a man of infinite wisdom, and chief of the physicians to Alnareschin, the great King of Persia.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_171">'"Alnareschin was the most dreadful tyrant that ever reigned over that country.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_172">He was of a fearful, suspicious, and cruel nature, having put to death, upon slight surmises, five-and-thirty of his queens, and above twenty sons, whom he suspected of conspiring.</span>
<a id="Page_296" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="296">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_173">Being at length wearied with the exercise of so many cruelties, and fearing the whole race of Caliphs would be extinguished, he sent for Helim, the good physician, and confided his two remaining sons, Ibrahim and Abdallah, then mere infants, to his charge, requesting him to bring them up in virtuous retirement.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_174">Helim had an only child, a girl of noble soul, and a most beautiful person.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_175">Abdallah, whose mind was of a more tender turn than that of Ibrahim, grew by degrees so enamoured of her conversation that he did not think he lived unless in the company of his beloved Balsora.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_176">'"The fame of her beauty was so great that it came to the ears of the king, who, pretending to visit the young princes, his sons, demanded of Helim the sight of his fair daughter.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_177">The king was so inflamed with her beauty and behaviour that he sent for Helim the next morning, and told him it was now his design to recompense him for all his faithful services, and that he intended to make his daughter Queen of Persia.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_178">'"Helim, who remembered the fate of the former queens, and who was also acquainted with the secret love of Abdallah, contrived to administer a sleeping draught to his daughter, and announced to the king that the news of his intention had overcome her.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_179">The king ordered that as he had designed to wed Balsora, her body should be laid in the Black Palace among those of his deceased queens.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_180">'"Abdallah soon fretted after his love, and Helim administered a similar potion to his ward, and he was laid in the same tomb.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_181">Helim, having charge of the Black Palace, awaited their revival, and then secretly supplied them with sustenance, and finally contrived, by dressing them as spirits, to convey them away from this sepulchre, and concealed them in a palace which had been bestowed on him by the king in reward for his recovering him from a dangerous illness.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_182">'"About ten years after their abode in this place the old king died.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_183">The new king, Ibrahim, being one day out hunting, and separated from his company, found himself, almost fainting with heat and thirst, at the foot of Mount Khacan, and, ascending the hill, he arrived at Helim's house and requested refreshments.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_184">Helim was, very luckily, there at that time, and after having set before the king the choicest of wines and fruits, finding him</span>
<a id="Page_297" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="297">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_185">wonderfully pleased with so seasonable a treat, told him that the best part of his entertainment was to come; upon which he opened to him the whole history of what had passed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_186">The king was at once astonished and transported at so strange a relation, and seeing his brother enter the room with Balsora in his hand, he leaped off from the sofa on which he sat, and cried out, ''Tis he!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_187">'tis my Abdallah!'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_188">Having said this, he fell upon his neck and wept.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_320">I frequently stand under a tree, and with great humanity pity one half of the world, and with equal contempt laugh at the other half.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_321">I shun the company of men, and seek that of oxen, and sheep, and deer, and bushes; and when I can hide myself for the moiety of a day from the sight of every creature but those that are dumb, I consider myself as monarch of all that I see or tread upon, and fancy that Nature smiles and the sun shines for my sake only.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_335">He that gets a hundred thousand pounds by a bubble—that is, by selling a bag of wind to his credulous countrymen—is a greater idol in every coffee-house in town than he who is worth but ninety thousand, though acquired by honest trading or ingenious arts, which profit mankind, and bring credit to his country; and thus every South Sea cub shall, by the sole merit of his million, vie for respect and followers with any lord in the land, though it should strangely happen, as it</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_356">By the sagacity shown in the remarks, I take the author to be some polite squire of Devon.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_357">In the following passages our traveller records his observations in the great metropolis:—</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_358">'"In this great city people are quite another thing than what they are out of it; insomuch, that he who will be very great with you in the country, will scarce pull off his hat to you in London.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_359">I once dined at Exeter with a couple of judges, and they talked to me</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_360">there</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_361">, and drank my health, and we were very familiar together.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_362">So when I saw them again passing through Westminster Hall, I was glad of it with all my heart, and ran to them with a broad smile, to ask them how they did, and to shake hands with them; but they looked at me so coldly and so proudly as you cannot imagine, and did not seem to know me, at which I was confounded, angry, and mad; but I kept my mind to myself.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_365">'People, put by their education into a narrow track of thinking, are as much afraid of getting out of it as children of quitting their leading-strings when first they learn to go.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_366">They are taught a raging fondness for a parcel of names that are never explained to them; and an implacable fierceness against another set of names that are never explained to them; so they jog on in the heavy steps of their forefathers, or in the wretched and narrow paths of poor-spirited and ignorant pedagogues.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_367">They believe they are certainly in the right, and therefore never take the pains to find out that they are certainly in the wrong.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_368">'From this cause it comes to pass that many English gentlemen are as much afraid of reading some English books as were the poor blind Papists of reading books prohibited by their priests; which were, indeed, all books that had either religion or sense in them.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_372">'Here is a squire come down from London who is very rich, and has bought a world of land in our county of Wilts.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_373">The first thing he did when he came among us was to declare that he would have no dealings nor conversation with any Whig whatsoever; and, to make his word good, having bespoke several beds and other furniture to a considerable value of an upholsterer here, he returned the whole upon the poor man's hands because his wife had a brother who was a Presbyterian parson.</span>
