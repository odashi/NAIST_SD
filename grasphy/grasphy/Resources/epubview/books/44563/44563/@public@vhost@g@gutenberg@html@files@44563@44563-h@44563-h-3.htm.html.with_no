<span id="SENTENCE_0">'The Adventures of Captain Greenland,' an anonymous novel published in 1752, is avowedly 'written in imitation of all those wise, learned, witty, and humorous authors who either have or hereafter may write in the same style and manner.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_1">The story, divided over a tedious number of books—like the high-flown romances of the 'Grand Cyrus' order—also resembles those antiquated and unreal elaborations in the astonishing intrepidity of its professed hero, Sylvius, who, however, engages, like his model 'Joseph Andrews,' in situations generally described as menial.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_2">Captain Greenland himself, denuded of his powerful swearing propensities, might be regarded at this date as an interesting curiosity, a British commander of the true-blue salt type.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_3">A parson, and other characters suggestive of the acquaintances we make in 'Joseph Andrews,' contribute to swell the 'dramatis personæ.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_4">A portion of the adventures, which are neither new nor startling, consists of escapes from Spanish convents, and complications connected with the Romanist faith, not unlike somewhat kindred allusions in Richardson's 'Sir Charles Grandison.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_5">A stage-coach journey occupies ten chapters of one book; and the travellers relieve this lengthy travel (from Worcester to London) by unfinished anecdotes.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_6">Captain Greenland relates an adventure with a highwayman who once stopped his coach.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_7">The</span>
<a id="Page_79" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="79">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_8">'gentleman of the road' bade the driver 'unrein.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_9">The captain seized his blunderbuss and 'jumped ashore,' thinking it a scandal that a gentleman who had the honour of commanding one of His Majesty's ships of war should suffer himself to be boarded and plundered by a single fellow.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_10">Being a little warm and hasty, he salutes his enemy with, '"Blank my heart, but you are a blank cowardly rascal, and a blank mean-spirited villain!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_11">You scoundrel, you! you lurk about the course here to plunder every poor creature you meet, that have nothing at all to defend themselves; but you dare not engage with one that is able to encounter with you.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_12">Here, you rascal! if you dare fight for it, win it and wear it."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_13">With that I pulled out my purse and money, and flung it to the ground between us; but the faint-hearted blank durst as well be blank'd as come near me.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_14">So after I had swore myself pretty well out of wind (judging from the captain's ordinary vernacular, the strongest lungs could not have held out long), I ran towards him with my cock'd blunderbuss ready in my hand; but he at that very moment tacked about, and sheer'd off.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_15">I now picked up my purse, and went aboard the coach; but, blank my heart!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_16">I can't forgive myself for not saluting the rascal with one broadside.'</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_17">At the conclusion of ten chapters of stage-coach journeying, the author brilliantly observes, 'He has cooped up his readers for a considerable time,' and the captain swears the coach is somewhat 'over-manned.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_18">'At night they were all exceedingly merry and agreeable; and the generous captain again insisted upon paying the bill himself, which he found no matter of fault with, but in the customary</span>
<a id="Page_80" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="80">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_19">article (at that place) of sixpence a head for firing; which he swore was as much as could have been demanded if they had supp'd at an inn in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.'</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_20">The next day's journey being happily concluded, without any extraordinary occurrences, they arrived about six o'clock in the afternoon at the 'Blue Boar Inn, in Holborn, where they all agreed to sup together, and to lie that night.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_21">Rosetta the heroine, and her brother, Sir Christopher, attended by the faithful Sylvius as steward, embark at Portsmouth for</span>
<a id="Page_81" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="81">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_22">Lisbon.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_23">After some thirty hours' sea-sickness, Rosetta resumed her usual cheerfulness by making merry over her late incapacity.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_24">'Sylvius was yet as bad as any of them.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_25">The knight (her brother) was also in the same helpless condition, and continued in the same manner till he was eased of the lofty tosses which were so plentifully bestowed on them by the restless Biscaian Bay.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_26">They all recover at last, and are diverted by the shoals of wanton porpoises.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_27">'By and by their remarks turned on their "little bark's climbing so wonderfully over the vast ridges of the mountainous waves, which formed perpetual and amazing prospects of over-rolling hills and vales, as could scarcely meet belief from those who had never been at sea."'</span>
</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00019">
<span id="SENTENCE_28">'JACK CONNOR.'</span>
</h3>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_29">'Jack Connor' is another instance of the novels written by imitators of Fielding.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_30">Aiming to produce an unaffected and easy style of fiction, enlivened by incidents of every-day interest, it falls far short of the standard to which it aspires, as one would reasonably suppose.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_31">The book is anonymous, and is dedicated to Henry Fox, 'Secretary at War,' and was published in 1752; it is founded on a rambling plot, detailing the adventures of a 'waif' thrown on the world by his Irish parents.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_32">The first volume is mostly occupied by youthful 'amours,' and ends with the 'Story Of Polly Gunn,' which unfortunately bears a certain resemblance to De Foe's 'Moll Flanders,' in a condensed form.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_33">'Jack Connor' had a patron, a marvellously proper man, the 'model of righteous walking,' and the dispenser of admirable precepts, over which the hero grew eminently sentimental; but directly after acted in direct opposition to the teaching of this worthy guardian.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_34">The pencilling we have selected from the margin of vol. i. illustrates a passage describing the scandals of the kitchen, which affixed to Jack Connor's benefactor, Mr. Kindly, the questionable honour of being father to his protégé.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_35">'I hope,' said Tittle, 'your la'ship won't be angry with me, only they say that the boy is as like Mr. Kindly as two peas; but they say, "Mem"——'</span>
<a id="Page_82" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="82">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_36">'Hold your impertinent tongue,' said my lady; 'is this the occasion of so much giggle?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_37">You are an ungrateful pack.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_38">I am sure 'tis false,'</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_40">'Indeed,' said Tittle, 'if I've said anything to offend your la'ship——'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_41">'Yes, madam,' said my lady, 'you have greatly offended me; and so you all have,'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_42">c.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_43">Poor Mrs. Tittle was not only vastly disappointed, but greatly frightened.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_44">She informed the rest of the reception she had met with.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_45">The servants were quite surprised at the oddity of her ladyship's temper, and quoted many examples diametrically opposite.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_46">'I'm sure,' said Mrs. Tittle, 'had I told as much to Squire Smart's lady, we should have laughed together about it the livelong night!'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_47">'Ay, ay,' said Mrs. Matthews, 'God bless the good Lady Malign!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_48">When I waited on her in Yorkshire, many a gown, and petticoat, and smock have I gotten for telling her half so much; but, to be sure, some people think themselves wiser than all the world!'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_49">'Hold, hold,' said Tom Blunt, the butler.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_50">'Now, d'ye see, if so be as how my lady is wrong, she'll do you right; and if so be as how my lady is right, how like fools and ninnihammers will you all look!'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_51">In vol. ii. we find Jack Connor resorting to the reputable profession of 'gentleman of the road;' he plans his first 'stand-and-deliver' venture in company with two experienced highwaymen.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_52">Hounslow is the popular spot selected for his</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_53">début</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_54">.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_55">Thither he proceeds in a post-chaise from Piccadilly, having arranged for his horse in advance.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_56">Two circumstances favour him; he knows a family in the neighbourhood, and he wears a surtout of a cloth that is blue on one side and red on the other, and that has no other lining.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_57">In a blue coat with scarlet cuffs he orders wine, arranges for</span>
<a id="Page_83" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="83">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_58">a return post-chaise, and enquires the address of the people whose name he knows.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_59">He then departs, secures his horse, and turns his coat; he is behind-hand, and the coach just then coming up, the two highwaymen lead the attack: one is shot, and the other disabled and captured.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_60">Connor escapes in the confusion, ties up his horse, turns his coat, and walks back to the inn for his post-chaise, which is delayed, one horse being wanting.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_61">The landlord enters.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_62">'There, now,' said he, 'is two fine gentlemen that have made a noble kettle of fish of it this morning!'</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_63">'Bless me, my dear,' said his wife, 'what's the matter?'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_64">'Not much; only a coach was stopped on the heath by three highwaymen, and two of 'em is now taken, and at the next inn.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_65">'Dear sirs,' said the landlady, ''tis the most preposteroustest thing in life that gentlefolks won't travel in post-chaises; and then they're always safe from these fellows.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_66">'Well,' said the husband, 'I must send after the third, who escaped; I'll engage to find out his scarlet coat before night.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_67">Connor, recollecting his situation, chimed in with the hostess, and spoke greatly against the disturbers of the public.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_68">At last he took leave, mounted his chaise, and got safe to London; but often thought the horses very bad.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_69">Jack Connor, after various vicissitudes, was at last reduced to service, and was employed as secretary by Sir John Curious, an infirm compound of wealth and avarice, married, in his last days, to a young wife.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_70">Connor became unpopular with the ladies of the establishment, on account of his over-correct behaviour.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_71">One day he was busy reading to Sir John, when Mr. Sampson, a wine merchant, entered.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_72">The knight had a great regard for this gentleman, and was extremely civil to him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_73">'Well, friend Sampson,' said he, 'time was</span>
<a id="Page_84" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="84">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_74">when we used to meet oftener; but this plaguy gout makes me perform a tedious quarantine, you see.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_75">'Ah, Sir John,' replied Mr. Sampson, 'you are at anchor in a safe harbour; but I have all your ailments, and am buffeted about in stormy winds.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_76">'Not so, not so,' answered the knight; 'I hope my old friend is in no danger of shipwreck.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_77">No misfortunes, I hope.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_78">'None,' said Mr. Sampson, 'but what my temper can bear.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_79">I have lost my only child, just such a youth as that (pointing to Jack).</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_80">I have lost the best part of my substance by the war, and I have found old age and infirmities.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_81">Sir John regretted that he could not assist his friend with a loan, but he paid his account for wine, and handed over Connor to assist Mr. Sampson in his business.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_82">After a long letter on the state of Ireland—which appeared even in 1744 a question beyond the wisdom of legislation to dispose of satisfactorily—the author apologises for his digressions with considerable novelty.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_83">'I am afraid I have carried my reader too far from the subject-matter of this history, and tried his patience; but I assure him that my indulgence has been very great, for, at infinite pains, I have curtailed the last chapter (the Irish question) at least sixty pages.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_84">Few know the difficulty of bridling the imagination, and reining back a hard-mouthed pen.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_85">It sometimes gets ahead, and, in spite of all our skill, runs away with us into mire and dirt; nay, at this minute I find my quill in a humour to gallop, so shall stop him short in time.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_86">The life of Connor is chequered.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_87">He finally figures as a captain of dragoons in the campaign in Flanders, under the 'Culloden' Duke.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_88">He performs deeds of valour with the army, and rescues a Captain Thornton from three assailants, preserves his life and secures his gratitude.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_89">He next appears at Cadiz, on a commercial errand, and he regains his long-lost mother in Mrs. Magraph, a</span>
<a id="Page_85" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="85">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_90">wealthy widow, to whom he had made love.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_91">This lady, who had saved thirty thousand pounds, was very communicative; she finally recognised him as her son, and acquainted him that Sir Roger Thornton, the life of whose son he had preserved, was in reality his father, and not Connor, as he had previously believed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_92">The hero then set out for Paris.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_93">The ship was ready to sail.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_94">All were concerned at losing so polite a companion, and he was loaded with praises and caresses.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_95">His mother could not bear it with that resignation she at first thought; but, however, she raised her spirits, and with many blessings saw him set sail.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_96">The voyage was prosperous, and he arrived at Marseilles, safe and in good health.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_97">He took post for Paris, and embraced his dear friend Captain Thornton, as indicated in the marginal illustration.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_98">Jack Connor marries a lord's daughter, and becomes an Irish landed gentleman.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_99">The author concludes with the regret that he has not the materials to reveal his hero's future.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_101">We gather from the copy of this work, which was formerly on the shelves of Thackeray's library, that 'Chrysal' had reached seven editions in 1771, having been originally published in 1760, with a highly laudatory dedication to William Pitt.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_102">The bookseller's prefix to the first edition is slightly imaginative.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_103">To describe its nature briefly, the publisher, while taking a country stroll in Whitechapel, then an Arcadian village, was overtaken by a shower, and sought shelter in a cottage where a</span>
<a id="Page_86" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="86">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_104">humble family were breakfasting.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_105">His eye was caught by a sheet of manuscript which had done duty for a butter-plate.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_106">Its contents interested him, and he learnt that the chandler next door wrapped up her commodities in such materials.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_107">He made an experimental purchase, which was done up in another leaf of the paper.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_108">Cautious enquiries elicited that brown paper being costly, and a quantity of old 'stuff' having been left by a long deceased lodger of her departed mother's, the manuscript was thus turned into use.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_109">The enterprising publisher invested 1</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_110">s.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_111">6</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_112">d.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_113">for brown paper, and secured the entire remaining sheets in exchange.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_114">Finding, on perusal, that he had secured matter of some literary value, he pursued his investigations with the same lady, and learned that the author was an unfortunate schemer, who, after wasting his entire fortune in seeking the philosopher's stone, perceived his folly too late, wrote the story of 'Chrysal' in ridicule of the fallacy of golden visions, and expired before he could realise any profit by the publication of his papers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_115">The bookseller secretly resolved to admit the good woman to a half share of the profits of her 'heirship,' and 'Chrysal' appeared.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_116">It excited some attention, and had various charges laid to its account.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_117">The scheme is ingenious, tracing the guinea from its projection, and giving an account of the successive stages of its changing existence.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_118">We are admitted to contemplate the influence of gold in various situations; with dissertations on 'traffic,' and, in short, follow the history of a guinea through the possession of numerous owners, male and female, while the reader is by these means introduced to some very curious situations.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_119">The little design in the margin occurs in the history of a horned cock, a parody on collectors of curiosities, describing the manner in which a noble 'virtuoso' was imposed upon by a cunning vendor of wonderful productions.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_120">There was considerable competition to secure the composite phenomenon, and when his lordship obtained it, a convocation of 'savants' was summoned to report on the marvel.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_123">While arguing that the bird had shed its horn in the course of nature, one of the company dropped some snuff near the bird's eye, who thereupon shook his head with sufficient violence to dislodge the remaining horn; exposing the imposture, and overwhelming the virtuoso with such vexation that the cock was sacrificed to Æsculapius forthwith.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_124">The guinea gets into the hands of a justice of the peace, in the shape of a bribe, and a very remarkable state of corruption and traffic in iniquity is displayed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_125">The little pencilling of a quaint figure holding the scales occurs on the margin of a paragraph which records a warm dispute between the justice and his clerk on the proportioning of their plunder, the clerk revolting against an arrangement by which it is proposed to confine him to a bare third!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_126">The dispute is checked by the arrival of some customers, matrons dwelling within the justice's district, who come to compound with him in regular form 'for the breach of those laws he is appointed to support.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_127">The sketches pencilled in 'Chrysal' do not follow the story very closely; indeed, they can hardly be intimately associated with the text they accompany.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_128">This, however, is quite an exceptional case; the drawings found in Mr. Thackeray's books being, in nearly every instance, very felicitous embodiments of the subject-matter of the works they illustrate.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_129">On a fly-leaf of 'Chrysal' is a jovial sketch of light-hearted and nimble-toed tars, forming a realistic picture of the good cheer a guinea may command, and immediately suggestive of bags of prize-money, apoplectically stored with the yellow boys which, in the good old days, were supposed to profusely line the pockets of true salts when they indulged in the delights of a spell on shore: this was the time when sailors experimented in frying, as the story represents them, superfluous watches in bacon-fat, as a scientific relaxation, when the ships were paid off at Portsmouth,</span>
<a id="Page_88" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="88">

<span id="SENTENCE_279">While I was playing at chess with Mr. Elliot, came the news of Lord Nelson's arrival, with Sir William and Lady Hamilton, Mrs. Cadogan, mother of the latter, and Miss Cornelia Knight, famous for her "Continuation of Rasselas" and her "Private Life of the Romans."</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_283">Oct. 3.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_284">—Dined at Mr. Elliot's, with only the Nelson party.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_285">It is plain that Lord Nelson thinks of nothing but Lady Hamilton,</span>
<a id="Page_109" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="109">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_286">who is totally occupied by the same object.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_287">She is bold, forward, coarse, assuming, and vain.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_288">Her figure is colossal, but, excepting her feet, well shaped.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_289">Her bones are large, and she is exceedingly</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_290">embonpoint</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_291">.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_292">She resembles the bust of Ariadne: the shape of all her features is fine, as is the form of her head, and particularly her ears; her teeth are a little irregular, but tolerably white; her eyes light blue, with a brown spot in one, which, though a defect, takes nothing away from her beauty and expression.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_293">Her eyebrows and hair are dark, and her complexion coarse.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_294">Her expression is strongly marked, variable, and interesting; her movements in common life ungraceful; her voice loud, yet not disagreeable.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_295">Lord Nelson is a little man, without any dignity; who, I suppose, must resemble what Suwarrow was in his youth, as he is like all the pictures I have seen of that general.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_296">Lady Hamilton takes possession of him, and he is a willing captive, the most submissive and devoted I have seen.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_297">Sir William is old, infirm, all admiration of his wife, and never spoke to-day but to applaud her.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_298">Miss Cornelia Knight seems the decided flatterer of the two, and never opens her mouth but to show forth their praise; and Mrs. Cadogan, Lady Hamilton's mother, is what one might expect.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_299">After dinner we had several songs in honour of Lord Nelson, written by Miss Knight, and sung by Lady Hamilton.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_300">She puffs the incense full in his face; but he receives it with pleasure and sniffs it up very cordially.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_301">The songs all ended in the sailor's way, with "Hip, hip, hip, hurra!" and a</span>
<a id="Page_110" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="110">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_302">bumper with the last drop on the nail, a ceremony I had never heard of or seen before.</span>

<p>

<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_304">Oct. 4.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_305">—Accompanied the Nelson party to Mr. Elliot's box at the opera.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_306">She and Lord Nelson were wrapped up in each other's conversation during the chief part of the evening.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_307">'</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_308">Oct. 5.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_309">—Went, by Lady Hamilton's invitation, to see Lord Nelson dressed for court.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_310">On his hat he wore the large diamond feather, or ensign of sovereignty, given him by the Grand Signior; on his breast the order of the Bath, the order he received as Duke of Bronte; the diamond star, including the sun or crescent, given him by the Grand Signior; three gold medals, obtained by three different victories; and a beautiful present from the King of Naples.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_311">On one side is His Majesty's picture, richly set, and surrounded with laurels, which spring from two united laurels at bottom, and support the Neapolitan crown at top; on the other is the Queen's cipher, which turns so as to appear within the same laurels, and is formed of diamonds on green enamel.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_312">In short, Lord Nelson was a perfect constellation of stars and orders.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_313">'</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_314">Oct. 7.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_315">—Breakfasted with Lady Hamilton, and saw her represent in succession the best statues and paintings extant.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_316">She assumes their attitude, expression, and drapery with great facility, swiftness, and accuracy.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_317">Several Indian shawls, a chair, some antique vases, a wreath of roses, a tambourine, and a few children are her whole apparatus.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_318">She stands at one end of the room, with a strong light on her left, and every other window closed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_319">Her hair is short, dressed like an antique, and her gown a simple calico chemise, very easy, with loose sleeves to the wrist.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_320">She disposes the shawls so as to form Grecian, Turkish, and other drapery, as well as a variety of turbans.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_321">Her arrangement of the turbans is absolutely sleight-of-hand; she does it so quickly, so easily, and so well.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_322">It is a beautiful performance, amusing to the most ignorant, and highly interesting to the lovers of art.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_323">The chief of her imitations are from the antique.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_324">Each representation lasts about ten minutes.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_325">It is remarkable that, though coarse and ungraceful in common life, she becomes highly graceful, and even beautiful, during this performance.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_326">After showing her attitudes, she sang, and I accompanied.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_327">Her voice is good and very strong, but she is frequently out of tune; her expression strongly</span>
<a id="Page_111" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="111">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_328">marked and various; but she has no flexibility, and no sweetness.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_329">She acts her songs....</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_330">'Still she does not gain upon me.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_331">I think her bold, daring, vain even to folly, and stamped with the manners of her first situation much more strongly than one would suppose, after having represented majesty, and lived in good company fifteen years.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_332">Her ruling passions seem to me vanity, avarice, and love for the pleasures of the table.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_333">Mr. Elliot says, "She will captivate the Prince of Wales, whose mind is as vulgar as her own, and play a great part in England."</span>

<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_335">Oct. 8.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_336">—Dined at Madame de Loss's, wife to the Prime Minister, with the Nelson party.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_337">The Electress will not receive Lady Hamilton, on account of her former dissolute life.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_338">She wished to go to court, on which a pretext was made to avoid receiving company last Sunday, and I understand there will be no court while she stays.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_339">Lord Nelson, understanding the Elector did not wish to see her, said to Mr. Elliot, "Sir, if there is any difficulty of that sort, Lady Hamilton will knock the Elector down, and —— me, I'll knock him down too!"</span>

<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_341">Oct. 9.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_342">—A great breakfast at the Elliots', given to the Nelson party.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_343">Lady Hamilton repeated her attitudes with great effect.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_344">All the company, except their party and myself, went away before dinner; after which Lady Hamilton, who declared she was passionately fond of champagne, took such a portion of it as astonished me.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_345">Lord Nelson was not behindhand, called more vociferously than usual for songs in his own praise, and after many bumpers proposed the Queen of Naples, adding, "She is my queen; she is queen to the backbone."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_346">Poor Mr. Elliot, who was anxious the party should not expose themselves more than they had done already, and wished to get over the last day as well as he had done the rest, endeavoured to stop the effusion</span>
<a id="Page_112" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="112">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_347">of champagne, and effected it with some difficulty, but not till the lord and lady, or, as he calls them, Antony and Moll Cleopatra, were pretty far gone.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_348">I was so tired, I returned home soon after dinner; but not till Cleopatra had talked to me a great deal of her doubts whether the queen would receive her, adding, "I care little about it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_349">I had much sooner she would settle half Sir William's pension on me."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_350">After I went, Mr. Elliot told me she acted Nina intolerably ill, and danced the</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_351">Tarantula</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_352">.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_353">During her acting, Lord Nelson expressed his admiration by the Irish sound of astonished applause, and by crying every now and then, "Mrs. Siddons be ——!"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_354">Lady Hamilton expressed great anxiety to go to court, and Mrs. Elliot assured her it would not amuse her, and that the Elector never gave dinners or suppers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_355">"What?" cried she, "no guttling!"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_356">Sir William also this evening performed feats of activity, hopping round the room on his backbone, his arms, legs, star and ribbon all flying about in the air.</span>

</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_359">—Mr.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_360">Elliot saw them on board to-day.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_361">He heard, by chance, from a king's messenger, that a frigate waited for them at Hamburg, and ventured to announce it formally.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_362">He says: "The moment they were on board, there was an end of the fine arts, of the attitudes, of the acting, the dancing, and the singing.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_363">Lady Hamilton's maid began to scold, in French, about some provisions which had been forgot.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_364">Lady Hamilton began bawling for an Irish stew, and her old mother set about washing the potatoes, which she did as cleverly as possible.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_365">They were exactly like Hogarth's actresses dressing in the barn."'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_366">At Berlin, the fair diarist was introduced to Beurnonville, the French minister, who had gained notoriety for his services at Valmy and Gemappes.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_367">He was one of the commissioners despatched by the convention to arrest Dumouriez, who, it may be remembered, treated him with marked cordiality; the special envoy of the republic was, however, arrested, with his companions, and delivered by the general into the hands of the Austrians.</span>

<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_369">Nov. 18-23.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_370">—I have been to a great supper at Count Schulenberg's.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_371">As usual, I saw Beurnonville, who was very attentive.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_372">He looks like an immense cart-horse, put by mistake in the finest caparisons; his figure is colossal and ungainly; and his uniform of blue and gold, which appears too large even for his large person, is half covered with the broadest gold lace.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_373">His</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_374">ton</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_375">is that of a</span>

<a id="Page_113" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="113">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_378">addresses himself to women, he affects a softness and</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_379">légèreté</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_380">, which reminds one exactly of the "Ass and the Spaniel," and his compliments are very much in the style of M. Jourdain.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_381">It is said, however, he is benevolent and well-meaning.</span>
