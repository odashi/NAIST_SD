<span id="SENTENCE_0">His frequentest works go out in single sheets, and are chanted from market to market to a vile tune and a viler throat; whilst the poor country wench melts like her butter to hear them.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_1">And these are the stories of some men of Tyburn, or of a strange monster broken loose; or sitting in a tap-room he writes sermons on judgments.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_2">He drops away at last, and his life, like a can too full, spills upon the bench.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_3">He leaves twenty shillings on the score, which his hostess loses.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_4">A Bowl Alley.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_5">A bowl alley is the place where there are three things thrown away besides bowlsâ€”to wit, time, money, and curses, and the last ten for one.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_6">The best sport in it is the gamesters, and he enjoys</span>
<a id="Page_193" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="193">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_7">it that looks on and bets not.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_8">It is the school of wrangling, and worse than the schools, for men will cavil here for a hair's breadth, and make a stir where a straw would end the controversy.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_9">No antic screws men's bodies into such strange flexures, and you would think them here senseless, to speak sense to their bowl, and put their trust in entreaties for a good cast.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_10">It is the best discovery of humours, especially in the losers, where you have fine variety of impatience, whilst some fret, some rail, some swear, and others more ridiculously comfort themselves with philosophy.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_11">To give you the moral of it, it is the emblem of the world, or the world's ambition; where most are short, or over, or wide, or wrong-biassed, and some few justle in to the mistress of fortune.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_12">And it is here as in the court, where the nearest are most spited, and all blows aimed at the toucher.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_14">A handsome hostess is the fairer commendation of an inn, above the fair sign, or fair lodgings.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_15">She is the loadstone that attracts men of iron, gallants and roarers, where they cleave sometimes long, and are not easily got off.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_16">Her lips are your welcome, and your entertainment her company, which is put into the reckoning too, and is the dearest parcel in it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_17">No citizen's wife is demurer than she at the first greeting, nor draws in her mouth with a chaster simper; but you may be more familiar</span>
<a id="Page_194" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="194">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_18">without distaste, and she does not startle at a loose jest.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_19">She is the confusion of a pottle of sack more than would have been spent elsewhere, and her little jugs are accepted to have her kiss excuse them.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_20">She may be an honest woman, but is not believed so in her parish, and no man is a greater infidel in it than her husband.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_22">A poor fiddler is a man and a fiddle out of case, and he in worse case than his fiddle.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_23">One that rubs two sticks together (as the Indians strike fire), and rubs a poor living out of it; partly from this, and partly from your charity, which is more in the hearing than giving him, for he sells nothing dearer than to be gone.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_24">He is just so many strings above a beggar, though he have but two; and yet he begs too.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_25">Hunger is the greatest pain he takes, except a broken head sometimes.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_26">Otherwise his life is so many fits of mirth, and 'tis some mirth to see him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_27">A good feast shall draw him five miles by the nose, and you shall track him again by the scent.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_28">His other pilgrimages are fairs and good houses, where his devotion is great to the Christmas; and no man loves good times better.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_29">He is in league with the tapsters for the worshipful of the inn, whom he torments next morning with his art, and has their names more perfect than their men.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_30">A new song is better to him than a new jacket, especially if it be lewd, which he calls merry; and hates naturally the puritan, as an enemy to this mirth.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_31">A country wedding and Whitsun-ale are the two main places he domineers in, where he goes for a musician, and overlooks the bagpipe.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_32">The rest of him is drunk, and in the stocks.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_33">A Coward.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_34">A coward is the man that is commonly most fierce against the coward, and labouring to take off this suspicion from himself; for the opinion of valour is a good protection to those that dare not use it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_35">No man is valianter than he is in civil company, and where he thinks no danger may come of it, and is the readiest man to fall upon a drawer and those that must not strike again; wonderfully exceptious and choleric where he sees men are loth to give him occasion, and you cannot pacify him better than by quarrelling with him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_36">The hotter you grow, the more temperate man is he; he protests he always honoured you, and the more you rail upon him, the more he honours you, and you threaten him at last into a very honest quiet man.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_37">The sight of a sword wounds him more sensibly than the stroke, for before that come, he is dead already.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_38">Every man is his master that dare beat him, and every man dares that knows him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_39">And he who dare do this is the only man that can do much with him; for his friend he cares not, as a man that carries no such terror as his enemy, which for this cause only is more potent with him of the two; and men fall out with him on purpose to get courtesies from him, and be bribed again to a reconcilement.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_40">A man in whom no secret can be bound up, for the apprehension of each danger loosens him, and makes him betray both the room and it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_41">He is a Christian merely for fear of hell fire; and if any religion could frighten him more, would be of that.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_65">As this book does not bear the reputation of being generally familiar, we give a slight sketch of its contents.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_66">The vitality of a work depends in so large a degree on the estimation which its subject happens to secure at the date of publication, that, as a rule, it may be held when a book is forgotten, or extinguished before its first spark of life has time to catch popular attention, the fault is its own, and, being buried, it is a charity to allow its last rest to remain undisturbed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_67">We are inclined to believe, however, that this little treatise forms an exception.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_68">The 'Essay in Defence of the Female Sex' is written by a lady.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_69">The third edition, which now comes under our consideration as having formed one of the works in Thackeray's library (illustrated with original little sketches of the characters dealt with by their authors), was published in 1697, at the signs of the 'Black Boy' and the 'Peacock,' both in Fleet Street.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_84">The paragraphs distinguished with little drawings, which we have extracted, may give an impression that the 'defence' consists of an attack on the male, rather than a vindication of the fair sex.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_85">The arguments of the gentle champion are, however, temperate and sensible, in parts; they are stated in a lively, quaint manner, and the general quality of the book may be considered superior to the average of its class and date.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_86">The preface, which discourses of vanity as the mainspring of our actions, deals with the characters it is designed to introduce in the work as with the mimic actors of a puppet-show; this coincidence with a similar assumption in the preface to the great novel of our century, from the pen of the gifted author who at one time possessed this little treatise, is worthy of a passing remark.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_89">According, therefore, to ancient and laudable custom, I thought fit to let you know, by way of preface or advertisement (call it which you please), that here are many fine figures within to be seen, as well worth your curiosity as any in Smithfield at Bartholomew-tide.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_90">I will not deny, reader, but that you may have seen some of them there already; to those that have I have little more to say, than that if they have a mind to see them again in effigy, they may do it here.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_99">'For scholars, though by their acquaintance with books, and conversing much with old authors, they may know perfectly the sense of the learned dead, and be perfect masters of the wisdom, be thoroughly informed of the state, and nicely skilled in the policies of ages long since past, yet by their retired and inactive life, their neglect of business, and constant conversation with antiquity, they are such strangers to, and so ignorant of, the domestic affairs and manners of their own country and times, that they appear like the ghosts of old Romans raised by magic.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_100">Talk to them of the Assyrian or Persian monarchies, the Grecian or Roman commonwealths, they answer like oracles; they are such finished statesmen, that we should scarce take them to have been less than confidants of Semiramis, tutors to Cyrus the Great, old cronies of Solon and Lycurgus, or privy councillors at least to the twelve CÃ¦sars successively.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_101">But engage them in a discourse that concerns the present times, and their native country, and they hardly speak the language of it, and know so little of the affairs of it, that as much might reasonably be expected from an animated Egyptian mummy.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_102">'They are much disturbed to see a fold or plait amiss in the picture of an old Roman gown, yet take no notice that their own are threadbare, out at the elbows, or ragged; or suffer more if Priscian's head be broken than if it were their own.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_103">They are excellent</span>
<a id="Page_200" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="200">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_104">guides, and can direct you to every alley and turning in old Rome, yet lose their way at home in their own parish.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_105">They are mighty admirers of the wit and eloquence of the ancients, and yet had they lived in the time of Cicero and CÃ¦sar, would have treated them with as much supercilious pride and disrespect as they do now with reverence.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_106">They are great hunters of ancient manuscripts, and have in great veneration anything that has escaped the teeth of time and rats, and if age has obliterated the characters 'tis the more valuable for not being legible.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_107">But if by chance they can pick out one word, they rate it higher than the whole author in print, and would give more for one proverb of Solomon under his own hand, than for all his wisdom.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_115">He is the terror of all the deer and poultry stealers in the neighbourhood, and is so implacable a persecutor of poachers that he keeps a register of all the guns and dogs in the hundred, and is the scare-beggar of the parish.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_116">Short pots, and unjustifiable dogs and nets, furnish him with sufficient matter of presentments to carry him once a quarter to the sessions, where he says little, eats and drinks much, and after dinner, hunts over the last chase, and so rides, worshipfully drunk, home again.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_126">His tailor and his barber are his cabinet council, to whom he is more beholden for what he is than to his Maker.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_127">He is one that has travelled to see fashions, and brought over with him the newest cut suits and the prettiest</span>

</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_128">fancied ribands for sword-knots.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_129">He should be a philosopher, for he studies nothing but himself, yet every one knows him better that thinks him not worth knowing.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_130">His looks and gestures are his constant lesson, and his glass is the oracle that resolves all his mighty doubts and scruples.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_131">He examines and refreshes his complexion by it, and is more dejected at a pimple than if it were a cancer.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_132">When his eyes are set to a languishing air, his motions all prepared according to art, his wig and his coat abundantly powdered, his gloves essenced, and his handkerchief perfumed, and all the rest of his bravery adjusted rightly, the greatest part of the day, as well as the business of it at home, is over; 'tis time to launch, and down he comes, scented like a perfumer's shop, and looks like a vessel with all her rigging under sail without ballast.' ...</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_133">'He first visits the chocolate-house, where he admires himself in the glass, and starts a learned argument on the newest fashions.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_134">From hence he adjourns to the play-house, where he is to be met again in the side box, from whence he makes his court to all the ladies in general with his eyes, and is particular only with the orange wench.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_135">After a while he engages some neighbouring vizor, and altogether they run over all the boxes, take to pieces every face, examine every feature, pass their censure upon every one, and so on to their dress; but, in conclusion, sees nobody complete, but himself, in the whole house.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_136">After this he looks down with contempt upon the pit, and rallies all the slovenly fellows and awkward "beaux," as he calls them, of the other end of the town; is mightily offended at their ill-scented snuff, and, in spite of all his</span>
<a id="Page_203" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="203">
</a>

<span id="SENTENCE_170">Yet this is but skirmishing, the hot service is in another place, when they engage the capons and quart pots; never was onset more vigorous, for they come to handy blows immediately, and now is the real cutting and slashing, and tilting without quarter: were the towns in Flanders all walled with beef, and the French as good meat as capons, and dressed the same way, the king need never beat his drums for soldiers; and all these gallant fellows would come in voluntarily, the meanest of which would be able to eat a marshal.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_260">This work, in two parts, by the author of 'Les Premiers Ages de la Nature' and 'Une Histoire des Religions,' gives evidence of wide-spread research.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_261">To the curious in 'dark' literature, A. Maury's compilation must form a vastly concise and interesting introduction to a subject which once absorbed a large proportion of the erudition and 'fond' wisdom of our ancestors.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_262">From its high seat amidst kings and profound sages, cabalistic art has, in this practical age, sunk so low that its exclusive privilege may be considered the delectation and delusion of the most forlorn ignorance.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_263">It is, indeed, a source of congratulation that magic and astrology in our day rarely rise above the basement (for their modern patrons inhabit the kitchen), unless they are admitted in the palpable form of 'parlour necromancy,' degenerating into mere manual dexterity and common-place conjuring tricks.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_264">A. Maury's work traces the progress of magic from its source among uncivilised nations, and in the earliest ages, through the history of the Chaldeans, the Persians, the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_265">He exhibits the struggle of Christianity with magic, until the greater power overcame vain superstitions.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_266">He</span>
<a id="Page_212" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="212">

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_268">In the Second Part the author reviews the subject of superstitions attaching to dreams, and defines their employment as a means of divination, from the earliest records down to a recent period.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_269">He then describes the demoniac origin, once attributed to mental and nervous derangements, and elucidates the assistance contributed by the imagination to the deceptions of so-called magic.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_270">He concludes by considering the production of mental phenomena by the use of narcotics, the destruction of reason and of the intellectual faculties, and closes his summary by treating of hypnotism and somnambulism.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_271">In the chapter describing the influence of magic on the teachings of the Neoplatonic school of philosophy, we find the arguments advanced in the paragraphs we extract, wittily and practically embodied in a little sketch of an antique divinity, introduced with modern attributes.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_272">'... The new school of Plato imagined a complete hierarchy of demons, with which they combined a portion of the divinities of the ancient Greek religion, reconstructed in a newer and more philosophical spirit.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_273">'In the doctrines expounded by the author of the "MystÃ¨res des Egyptiens," who had borrowed most of his ideas from the Egyptian theology, demons are represented as veritable divinities, who divide the government of the world with the deities.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_274">'The inconsistent chronological confusion which prevailed at that period frequently offers similar contradictions; for the doctrines of antiquity, while taking their position in the new philosophy, had not been submitted to the modifications necessary to bring them into harmony with the later system.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_275">'... The severity directed by Church and State against magicians and sorcerers was not solely inspired by the terrors of demons or a dread of witchcraft.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_276">'... Although there existed in the rites of magic many foolish ceremonials that were harmless and inoffensive, the perpetuation of the observances of the ancient Polytheism were, however, employed as a veil, beneath which existed practices that were absolutely criminal, stamped with the most atrocious and sanguinary superstitions.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_277">The preparation of poisons played a considerable part in these observances, and witchcraft was not entirely confined to mere influences on the mind.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_278">Those who connected themselves with sorcery most frequently employed it with a view of gratifying either personal vengeance or culpable covetousness.'</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_279">In the chapter on '</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_280">Possession DÃ©moniaque</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_281">,' devoted to the demoniacal origin attributed to nervous and mental afflictions, we find a quaint pencil-heading which precedes the extracts we have made, to explain the matter it illustrates.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_282">'... The ancients no more succeeded in mastering the natural character and physical origin of disease than they were able to recognise the constancy of the phenomena of the universe.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_283">'All descriptions of sickness, especially epidemics and mental or nervous affections, were particularly reputed of supernatural agency; the first on account of their unexpected approaches, and their contagious and deadly effects; the second on the grounds of their mysterious origin, and the profound affections they bring either to the mind, the muscular system, or the sensations.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_284">'When an epidemic broke out they immediately concluded that a divinity was abroad, sent forth to execute vengeance or to</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_306">Mr. Braid, of Burlington House, Manchester, a doctor by profession, is a believer in and exponent of hypnotism.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_307">A great portion of his little work reviews the criticisms on earlier editions, or deals with statements regarding Colquhoun's 'History of Magic.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_308">Its author, while rejecting the doctrines known as animal mesmerism and magnetism, admits the effects they are declared to produce; but he refers such results to hypnotismâ€”a state of induced sleepâ€”into which a patient may be thrown by artificial contrivance.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_309">It is possible that the contents of this book would not prove of much general interest excepting to amateurs of 'animal magnetism;' but we give one extract, which may prove of service to those who do not happen to be already informed of the theory it advances, which is one that every reader can practically test:â€”</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_310">'In my work on hypnotism,' observes Mr. Braid, 'published in 1843, I explained how "tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep," might be procured, in many instances, through a most simple device, by the patient himself.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_311">All that is required for this purpose is simply to place himself in a comfortable posture in bed, and then to close the eyelids, and turn up the eyeballs gently, as if looking at a distant object, such as an imaginary star, situated somewhat above and behind the forehead, giving the whole concentrated attention of the mind to the idea of maintaining a steady view of the star, and breathing softly, as if in profound attention, the mind at the same time yielding to the idea that sleep will ensue, and to the tendency to somnolence which will creep upon him whilst engaged in this act of fixed attention.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_312">Mr. Walker's method of "procuring sleep at will," by desiring the patient to maintain a fixed act of attention by imagining himself watching his breath issuing slowly from his nostrils, after having placed his body in a comfortable position in bed, which was first published by Dr. Binns, is essentially the same as my own method,</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_314">Professor Gregory, in his 'Letters to a Candid Inquirer,' after describing the induction of sleep effected by reading a class of books of a dry character, remarks: 'But let these persons (sufferers from a difficulty in getting off to sleep) try the experiment of placing a small bright object, seen by the reflection of a safe and distant light, in such a position that the eyes are strained a little upwards or backwards, and at such a distance as to give a tendency to squinting, and they will probably never again have recourse to the venerable authors above alluded to.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_315">Sir David Brewster, who, with more than youthful ardour, never fails to investigate any curious fact connected with the eye, has not only seen Mr. Braid operate, but has also himself often adopted this method of inducing sleep, and compares it to the feeling we have when, after severe and long-continued bodily exertion, we sit or</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_316">lie down and fall asleep, being overcome, in a most agreeable manner, by the solicitations of Morpheus, to which, at such times, we have a positive pleasure in yielding, however inappropriate the scene of our slumbers.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_317">Among the contents are numerous instances of magnetism, and anecdotes of experiments, which have been amusingly 'hit off' in little marginal sketches.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_318">One of the best of these is an illustration of the contagious dancing mania said to be excited by the bite of the tarantula spiderâ€”'against the effect of which neither youth nor age afforded any protection, so that old men of ninety threw away their crutches,' and the very sight of those so affected was equally potent.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_319">These sketches are, however, so small that we think it advisable to exclude them from our selection.</span>
