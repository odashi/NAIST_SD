<span id="SENTENCE_50">Thackeray's last visit to the Charterhouse—College days—Pendennis at Cambridge—Sketches of University worthies—Sporting subjects—Etchings at Cambridge—Pencillings in old authors—Pictorial Puns—'The Snob,' a Literary and Scientific Journal—'Timbuctoo,' a prize poem.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_51">In Thackeray's schooldays the Charterhouse enjoyed considerable reputation under the head-mastership of Dr. Russell, whose death happened in the same year as that of his illustrious pupil.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_52">No one who has read Thackeray's novels can fail to know the kind of life he led here.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_53">He has continually described his experiences at this celebrated school—with the venerable archway into Charterhouse Square, which still preserves an interesting token of the old monkish character of the neighbourhood.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_54">Only a fortnight before his death he was there again, as was his custom, on the anniversary of the death of Thomas Sutton, the munificent founder of the school.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_55">'He was there,' says one who has described the scene, 'in his usual back seat in the quaint old chapel.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_56">He went thence to the oration in the Governor's room; and as he walked up to the orator with his contribution, was received with such hearty applause as only Carthusians can give to one who has immortalised their school.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_57">At the banquet afterwards he sat at the side of his old friend and artist-associate in "Punch," John Leech; and in a humorous speech proposed, as a toast, the noble foundation which he had adorned by his literary fame, and made popular in his works.' 'Divine service,' says another describer of this scene, for ever memorable as the last appearance of Thackeray in public life, 'took place at four o'clock, in the quaint old chapel; and the appearance of the brethren in their black gowns, of the old stained glass and carving in the chapel, of the tomb of Sutton, could hardly fail to give a peculiar and interesting character to the service.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_58">Prayers were</span>
<a id="Page_48" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="48">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_59">said by the Rev. J. J. Halcombe, the reader of the house.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_60">There was only the usual parochial chanting of the</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_61">Nunc Dimittis</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_62">; the familiar Commemoration-day psalms, cxxii. and c., were sung after the third collect and before the sermon; and before the general thanksgiving the old prayer was offered up expressive of thankfulness to God for the bounty of Thomas Sutton, and of hope that all who enjoy it might make a right use of it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_63">The sermon was preached by the Rev. Henry Earle Tweed, late Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, who prefaced it with the "Bidding Prayer," in which he desired the congregation to pray generally for</span>
<a id="Page_49" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="49">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_64">all public schools and colleges, and particularly for the welfare of the house "founded by Thomas Sutton for the support of age and the education of youth."'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_68">From Charterhouse School Thackeray went to Trinity College, Cambridge, about 1828, the year of his leaving the Charterhouse, and among his fellow-students there had Mr. John Mitchell Kemble, the great Anglo-Saxon scholar, and Mr. Tennyson.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_69">With the latter—then unknown as a poet—he formed an acquaintance which he maintained to the last, and no reader of the Poet Laureate had a more earnest admiration for his productions than his old Cambridge associate, Thackeray.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_70">At college, Thackeray kept seven or eight terms, but took no degree; though he was studious, and his love of classical literature is apparent in most of his writings, either in his occasional apt two words from Horace, or in the quaint and humorous adoption of Latin idioms</span>
<a id="Page_50" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="50">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_71">in which, in his sportive moods, he sometimes indulged.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_72">A recent writer tells us that his knowledge of the classics—of Horace at least—was amply sufficient to procure him an honourable place in the 'previous examination.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_89">There is a certain rude fitness and grotesque vigour about the animals which he sketched at the period of life we are describing; but his skill in this respect certainly advanced with practice, and the horses he had occasion to introduce into his cuts when his fun was at its height—such, for example, as the burlesque illustrations which we find scattered about the inimitable pages of Mr. Punch—were really very original and spirited; although perhaps they are barely the steeds which would</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_93">It is possible that Thackeray's bill to his livery stable keeper kept pace with his other expenses; but his experience in this respect was not fruitless.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_94">When he had occasion to mix with the world, and especially while studying society abroad, it embittered his judgment against the University to realise how little return, beyond that indefinite and somewhat bumptious quality known as 'tone,' he had really obtained in return for the expenses of a college career.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_95">The youth of the Continent, with whom he had the fortune to associate for some time, made him conscious, by their own accomplishments, of those parts of a gentleman's education which are ignored at our Universities, and which form, it must be confessed,</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_100">Besides his fancy for etching plates of horses and men of ultra and parodied fashion, for designing plates of the modern rake's progress at the Universities, and punning cuts, we may assume that Thackeray shared with his ideal Pendennis most of those tastes indulged by lucky youths when life is opening, and reflection does not trouble them.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_101">Like his hero, he enjoyed a fine amateur perception for rare editions, and had a fancy for the glories of costly bindings: we are told that the tall copies, the gilding, marbling, and blind-tooling put on his book-shelves were marvellous to behold.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_102">The same just appreciation of true art which, later on, directed Thackeray's criticisms of the picture galleries, taught Pen to despise</span>
<a id="Page_56" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="56">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_103">the tawdry and meretricious pictures of horses and opera dancers which often captivate the judgment of fledglings, and gifted him with a love for fine prints, for Rembrandt etchings, line-engravings after Strange, and Wilkie's before the letter; with which he hung his rooms, to the admiration of those who were capable of understanding his good taste.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_104">His mind did not despise the allurements of dress; and Pen was elaborately attired.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_105">It was a repeated axiom of Thackeray's, that it was good for a youth at one period to indulge in this vanity of fine apparel as a preliminary stage to more developed ambitions of standing well with the world.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_107">It will be recollected that eventually Pendennis was plucked; and a feeling, in some degree morose, and unequivocally indignant, seems to have taken possession of Thackeray's mind whenever he dwells on the college careers of the creations of his fancy.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_108">In the 'Shabby Genteel Story,' which he first gave to the world in the columns of 'Fraser' (1840), he lashes the system for the defects of the individuals who may have been perverted by its more injurious influences; nor does he credit the Universities with conferring any solid advantages.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_109">He enquires, somewhat vengefully, the amount of ruin that has been inflicted by the temptations to which youths are exposed in such a course of training as is understood in England by 'the education of a gentleman.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_110">The 'learning to fight for oneself,' he argues, implants an early habit of selfishness.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_115">In return for the two thousand pounds or so which had been spent in acquiring 'the tone,' he brings George Brandon—who is certainly as black a sheep as any University can produce—abruptly away from his college, ruined in heart and principle; boasting a small quantity of classics and mathematics; with an utter contempt for his inferiors, an enmity against his equals; a fulsome desire to be reckoned one of those above him, and to copy the extravagances incident to high position; an easy, confident address; sybarite habits, utter heartlessness, and tastes which must be gratified without scruple as to the means: 'pretty compensation,' writes the author, 'for all he had lost in gaining them.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_120">His first efforts in etching on copper were probably produced about the period of which we treat; the subjects of nearly all of these plates—none of which, we believe, were ever published—were evidently suggested by incidents in the career of an undergraduate.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_121">The margins and fly-leaves of a copy of Ovid's 'Opera omnia,' one of Black's editions of the Classics (1825), offer various whimsical illustrations of certain portions of the poems; we incline to the impression, however, that although some of these parodies may be referred to Thackeray's college days, to others must be assigned a considerably later date.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_156">It was in the year 1829 that he commenced, in conjunction with a friend and fellow-student, to edit a series of humorous papers, published in that city, which bore the title of 'The Snob: a Literary and Scientific Journal.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_157">The first number appeared on April 9 in that year, and the publication was continued weekly.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_158">Though affecting to be a periodical, it was not originally intended to publish more than one number; but the project was carried on for eleven weeks, in which period Mr. Lettsom had resigned the entire management to his friend.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_159">The contents of each number—which consisted only of four pages—were scanty and slight, and were made up of squibs and humorous sketches in verse and prose, many of which, however, show some germs of that spirit of wild fun which afterwards distinguished</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_254">The buoyant spirit, vigorous nature, and absence of affectation which are peculiarly the property of that great novelist, must have highly delighted the budding author.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_256">by some means he managed to get possession of various novels now completely obsolete, the productions of less brilliant contemporaries of Fielding, who were tempted by the success of his frankly penned novels to attempt to reach a similar success by walking servilely in the footsteps of the inaugurator of what may be considered the natural order of English novel writing.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_266">The edition (1742) of Fielding's earliest novel which formed a portion of Mr. Titmarsh's library has been enriched by certain characteristic illustrations of the drollest incidents.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_267">But few of Thackeray's readers can fail to remember his sincere appreciation of the works of his brilliant predecessor, Justice Fielding, the founder of that unaffected school of novel-writing which has since been rendered illustrious by many masterpieces of genius.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_268">It is singularly appropriate that 'Joseph Andrews' happens to form one of the series distinguished with Thackeray's pencillings, as no one acquainted with his writings can fail to recall his tenderly affectionate allusions to the author of 'Tom Jones.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_269">On the fly-leaf of 'Joseph Andrews' occurs the group of Lady Booby tempting the Joseph of the Georgian era, which is engraved above: the cut gives, without effort, a key to the wittiest of sly satires; for we cannot easily forget that merry mischievous Fielding projected this work as a ludicrous contrast to the exemplary 'Pamela,' whose literary success brought its well-meaning prosy author so much fame, profit, and flattery.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_270">The wicked irony of Fielding was peculiarly shocking to sensitive Richardson; and it is certain that the persecuted Pamela appears shorn of much of her dignity when associated with the undignified temptations suffered by her unexceptionable brother 'Joseph.'</span>
<a id="Page_75" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="75">

</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_271">The substance of this novel is so generally familiar that the merest reference will refresh the memories of our readers so far as the incidents illustrated by these slight pencillings are concerned.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_272">Parson Adams, it may be remembered, endeavoured to raise a loan on a volume of manuscript sermons to assist Joseph Andrews, when Tow-mouse (the landlord), who mistrusted the security, offered excuses.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_273">Poor Adams was extremely dejected at this disappointment.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_274">He immediately applied to his pipe, his constant friend and comfort in his afflictions; and leaning over the rails, he devoted himself to meditation, assisted by the inspiring fumes of tobacco.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_275">He had on a night-cap drawn over his wig, and a short great coat, which half covered his cassock; a dress which, added to something comical enough in his countenance, composed a figure likely to attract the eyes of those who were not over-given to observation.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_276">Joseph Andrews and Parson Adams arrived at the inn in no cheery plight, the hero's leg having been injured by a propensity for performing unexpected genuflections, the pride of a horse borrowed by the parson for the occasion.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_277">The host, a surly fellow, treated the damaged Joseph with roughness, and Parson Adams briskly resented the landlord's brutality by 'sending him sprawling' on his own floor.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_278">His wife retaliated by seizing a pan of hog's-blood, which unluckily stood on the dresser, and discharging its contents in the good parson's face.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_279">Mrs. Slipshod entered the kitchen at this critical moment, and attacked the hostess with</span>
<a id="Page_76" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="76">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_280">a skill developed by practice, tearing her cap, uprooting handfuls of hair, and delivering a succession of dexterous facers.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_281">Parson Adams, when he required a trifling loan, ventured to wait on the swinish Parson Trulliber, whose wife introduced Adams in error, as 'a man come for some of his hogs.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_282">Trulliber asserted that his animals were all pure fat, and upwards of twenty score apiece; he then dragged the parson into his stye, which was but two steps from his parlour-window, insisting that he should examine them before he would speak one word with him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_283">Adams, whose natural complacence was beyond any artifice, was obliged to comply before he was suffered to explain himself, and laying hold of one of their tails, the wanton beast gave such a sudden spring that he threw poor Adams full length in the mire.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_284">Trulliber, instead of assisting him to get up, burst into laughter, and, entering the stye, said to Adams, with some contempt, 'Why, dost not know how to handle a hog?'</span>
