<span id="SENTENCE_5">'Sir,—As I have passed much of life in disgust and suspense, and lost many opportunities of advantage by a passion which I have reason to believe prevalent in different degrees over a great part of mankind, I cannot but think myself well qualified to warn those who are yet uncaptivated of the dangers which they incur by placing themselves within its influence.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_6">'In the course of even prosperity I was one day persuaded to buy a ticket in the lottery.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_7">At last the day came, my ticket appeared, and rewarded all my care and sagacity with a despicable prize of fifty pounds.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_8">'My friends, who honestly rejoiced upon my success, were very coldly received; I hid myself a fortnight in the country that my chagrin might fume away without observation, and then, returning to my shop, began to listen after another lottery.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_9">'With the news of a lottery I was soon gratified, and, having now found the vanity of conjecture and inefficacy of computation, I resolved to take the prize by violence, and therefore bought forty tickets, not omitting, however, to divide them between the even and the odd, that I might not miss the lucky class.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_10">Many conclusions did I form, and many experiments did I try, to determine from which of those tickets I might most reasonably expect riches.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_11">At last, being unable to satisfy myself by any modes of reasoning, I wrote the numbers upon dice, and allotted five hours every day to the amusement of throwing them in a garret; and examining the event by an exact register, found, on the evening before the lottery was drawn, that one of my numbers had turned up five times more than any of the rest in three hundred and thirty thousand throws.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_12">'This experiment was fallacious; the first day presented the ticket a detestable blank.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_13">The rest came out with different fortune, and in conclusion I lost thirty pounds by this great adventure.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_14">'The prize which had been suffered to slip from me filled me with anguish, and, knowing that complaint would only expose me to ridicule, I gave myself up silently to grief, and lost by degrees my appetite and my rest.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_25">'Anningait and Ajut, a Greenland History.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_26">'In one of the large caves to which the families of Greenland retire together to pass the cold months, and which may be termed their villages or cities, a youth and maid, who came from different</span>
<a id="Page_401" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="401">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_27">parts of the country, were so much distinguished for their beauty that they were called by the rest of the inhabitants Anningait and Ajut, from their supposed resemblance to their ancestors of the same names who had been transformed of old into the sun and moon.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_28">'The elegance of Ajut's dress, and the judicious disposition of her ornaments of coral and shells, had such an effect upon Anningait that he could no longer be restrained from a declaration of his love.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_29">He, therefore, composed a poem in her praise, in which, among other heroic and tender sentiments, he protested that, "She was beautiful as the vernal willow, and fragrant as thyme upon the mountains; that her fingers were white as the teeth of the morse, and her smile grateful as the dissolution of the ice; that he would pursue her though she should pass the snows of the midland cliffs, or seek shelter in the caves of the eastern cannibals; that he would tear her from the embrace of the genius of the rocks, snatch her from the paws of Amaroc, and rescue her from the ravine of Hafgufa."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_30">'This ode being universally applauded, it was expected that Ajut would soon yield to such fervour and accomplishments; but Ajut, with the natural haughtiness of beauty, expected all the forms of courtship; and before she would confess herself conquered the sun returned, the ice broke, and the season of labour called all to their employments.</span>
</p>
<div class="figright">
<img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@44563@44563-h@images@i-425.jpg" alt="">
</img>
</div>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_31">'It happened that a tempest drove the fish to a distant part of the coast before Anningait had completed his store; he therefore entreated Ajut that she would at last grant him her hand and accompany him to that part of the country whither he was now summoned of necessity.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_32">Ajut thought him not yet entitled to such condescension, but proposed, as a trial of constancy, that he should return at the end of summer to the cavern where their acquaintance commenced, and there expect the reward of his assiduities.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_33">But Anningait tried to soften this resolution: he feelingly represented the uncertainty of existence and the dangers of the passage, and his loneliness when</span>
<a id="Page_402" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="402">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_34">distant from the object of his love.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_35">"Consider, Ajut," urged he, "a few summer days, a few winter nights, and the life of man is at an end.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_36">Night is the time of ease and festivity, of revels and gaiety; but what will be the flaming lamp, the delicious seal, or the soft oil without the smile of Ajut?"</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_37">'The eloquence of Anningait was vain; the maid continued inexorable, and they parted with ardent promises to meet again before the night of winter.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_38">Anningait, however discomposed by the dilatory coyness of Ajut, was resolved to omit no tokens of amorous respect, and therefore presented her at his departure with the skins of seven white fawns, of five swans, and eleven seals, with three marble lamps, ten vessels of seal-oil, and a large kettle of brass which he had purchased from a ship at the price of half a whale and two horns of sea-unicorns.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_39">'Ajut was so much affected by the fondness of her lover, or so much overpowered by his munificence, that she followed him to the seaside; and, when she saw him enter the boat, wished aloud that he might return with plenty of skins and oil, that neither the mermaids might snatch him into the deeps, nor the spirits of the rocks confine him in their caverns.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_40">'Parted from each other, the lovers devoted themselves to the remembrances of their affection; Anningait devoted himself to fishing and the chase with redoubled energy, that his stores for the future might exceed the expectations of his bride; and Ajut mourned the absence of her betrothed with ceaseless fidelity.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_41">She neglected the ornaments of her person, and, to avoid the solicitations of her lover's rivals, withdrew herself into complete seclusion.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_42">Thus passed the months of separation.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_43">At last Ajut saw the great boat in which Anningait departed stealing slow and heavy laden along the coast.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_44">She ran with all the impatience of affection to catch her lover in her arms, and relate her constancy and sufferings.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_45">When the company reached the land they informed her that Anningait, after the fishery was ended, being unable to support the slow passage of the vessel of carriage, had set out before them in his fishing-boat, and they expected at their arrival to have found him on shore.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_46">'Ajut, distracted at this intelligence, was about to fly into the hills without knowing why, though she was now in the hands of her parents, who forced her back to her own hut and endeavoured</span>
<a id="Page_403" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="403">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_47">to comfort her; but when at last they retired to rest, Ajut went down to the beach, where, finding a fishing-boat, she entered it without hesitation, and, telling those who wondered at her rashness that she was going in search of Anningait, rowed away with great swiftness and was seen no more.</span>
</p>
<div class="figcenter">

</img>
</div>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_48">'The fate of these lovers gave occasion to various fictions and conjectures.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_49">Some are of opinion that they were changed into stars; others imagine that Anningait was seized in his passage by the genius of the rocks, and that Ajut was transformed into a mermaid, and still continues to seek her lover in the deserts of the sea.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_50">But the general persuasion is that they are both in that part of the land of souls where the sun never sets, where oil is always fresh, and provisions always warm.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_51">The virgins sometimes throw a thimble and a needle into the bay from which the hapless maid departed, and when a Greenlander would praise any couple for virtuous affection he declares that they love like Anningait and Ajut.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_62">'Dear Mr. Rambler,—I have been four days confined to my chamber by a cold, which has already kept me from three plays, nine sales, five shows, and six card-tables, and put me seventeen visits behind; and the doctor tells my mamma that, if I fret and</span>
<a id="Page_404" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="404">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_63">cry, it will settle in my head, and I shall not be fit to be seen these six weeks.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_64">But, dear Mr. Rambler, how can I help it?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_65">At this very time Melissa is dancing with the prettiest gentleman; she will breakfast with him to-morrow, and then run to two auctions, and hear compliments, and have presents; then she will be dressed and visit, and get a ticket to the play, then go to cards, and win, and come home with two flambeaus before her chair.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_66">Dear Mr. Rambler, who can bear it?</span>
</p>
<hr class="l30">

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_67">'I am at a loss to guess for what purpose they relate such tragic stories of the cruelty, perfidy, and artifices of men, who, if they ever were so malicious and destructive, have certainly now reformed their manners.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_68">I have not, since my entrance into the world, found one who does not profess himself devoted to my service, and ready to live or die as I shall command him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_69">They are so far from intending to hurt me that their only contention is, who shall be allowed most closely to attend and most frequently to treat me; when different places of entertainment or schemes of pleasure are mentioned, I can see the eyes sparkle and the cheeks glow of him whose proposals obtain my approbation; he then leads me off in triumph, adores my condescension, and congratulates himself that he has lived to the hour of felicity.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_70">Are these, Mr. Rambler, creatures to be feared? and is it likely that any injury will be done me by those who can enjoy life only while I favour them with my presence?</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_71">'As little reason can I yet find to suspect them of stratagems and fraud.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_72">When I play at cards they never take advantage of any mistakes, nor exact from me a rigorous observation of the game.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_73">Even Mr. Shuffle, a grave gentleman, who has daughters older than myself, plays with me so negligently that I am sometimes inclined to believe he loses his money by design; and yet he is so fond of play that he says he will one day take me to his house in the country, that we may try by ourselves who can conquer.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_74">I have not yet promised him; but when the town grows a little empty I shall think upon it, for I want some trinkets, like Letitia's, to my watch.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_75">I do not doubt my luck, but I must study some means of amusing my relations.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_76">'For all these distinctions I find myself indebted to that beauty which I was never suffered to hear praised, and of which, therefore,</span>
<a id="Page_405" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="405">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_77">I did not before know the full value.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_78">This concealment was certainly an intentional fraud, for my aunts have eyes like other people, and I am every day told that nothing but blindness can escape the influence of my charms.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_79">Their whole account of that world which they pretend to know so well has been only one fiction entangled with another; and though the modes of life oblige me to continue some appearances of respect, I cannot think that they who have been so clearly detected in ignorance or imposture have any right to the esteem, veneration, or obedience of,</span>

</p>
<p>

<span id="SENTENCE_137">'The idea of publishing a periodical paper in Edinburgh took its rise in a company of gentlemen whom particular circumstances of connection brought frequently together.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_138">Their discourse often turned upon subjects of manners, of taste, and of literature.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_139">By one of these accidental resolutions, of which the origin cannot easily be traced, it was determined to put their thoughts into</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_167">After glancing over the pages, he said he could have wished they had set apart a corner for intelligence from America; but, having taken off his spectacles, wiped, and put them into their case, he said, with a tone of discovery, he had found out the reason why there was nothing of that sort in the "Mirror"—it was in order to save the tax upon newspapers.'</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_173">'When the day of their return came, my girl, who had been constantly on the look-out, ran to tell me she saw a postchaise driving to the gate.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_174">But, judge of my astonishment when I saw two pale, emaciated figures get out of the carriage, in their dress and looks resembling monkeys rather than human creatures.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_175">What was still worse, their manners were more displeasing than their appearance.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_176">When my daughter ran up, with tears of joy in her eyes, to embrace her brother, he held her from him, and burst into an immoderate fit of laughter at something in her dress that appeared to him ridiculous.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_177">He was joined in the laugh by his younger brother, who was pleased, however, to say that the girl was not ill-looking, and, when taught to put on her clothes, and to use a little</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_178">rouge</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_179">, would be tolerable.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_180">'Mortified as I was at this impertinence, the partiality of a parent led me to impute it, in a great measure, to the levity of youth; and I still flattered myself that matters were not so bad as they appeared to be.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_181">In these hopes I sat down to dinner.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_182">But there the behaviour of the young gentlemen did not, by any means, tend to lessen my chagrin.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_183">There was nothing at table they could eat; they ran out in praise of French cookery, and seemed even to be adepts in the science; they knew the component ingredients of most fashionable</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_193">Mr. Fleetwood, a man of excessive refinement and delicacy of taste, is described as paying visits to his friends in the country.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_194">But the pleasures which might possibly be derived from this exercise are marred by his false sensibility.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_195">'Our next visit was to a gentleman of liberal education and elegant manners, who, in the earlier part of his life, had been much in the polite world.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_196">Here Mr. Fleetwood expected to find pleasure and enjoyment sufficient to atone for his two previous experiences which were far from agreeable; but here, too, he was disappointed.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_197">'Mr. Selby, for that was our friend's name, had been several years married.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_198">His family increasing, he had retired to the country, and, renouncing the bustle of the world, had given himself up to domestic enjoyments; his time and attention were devoted chiefly to the care of his children.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_199">The pleasure which he himself felt in humouring all their little fancies made him forget how troublesome that indulgence might be to others.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_200">'The first morning we were at his house, when Mr. Fleetwood came into the parlour to breakfast, all the places at table were occupied by the children; it was necessary that one of them should be displaced to make room for him; and, in the disturbance which this occasioned, a teacup was overturned, and scalded the finger of Mr. Selby's eldest daughter, a child about seven years old, whose whimpering and complaining attracted the whole attention during breakfast.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_201">That being over, the eldest boy came forward with a book in his hand, and Mr. Selby asked Mr. Fleetwood to hear him read his lesson.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_202">Mrs. Selby joined in the request, though both looked as if they were rather conferring a favour on their</span>
<a id="Page_415" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="415">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_203">guest.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_204">The eldest had no sooner finished, than the youngest boy presented himself; upon which his father observed that it would be doing injustice to Will not to hear him as well as his elder brother Jack, and in this way was my friend obliged to spend the morning in performing the office of a schoolmaster to the children in succession.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_205">'Mr. Fleetwood liked a game at whist, and promised himself a party in the evening, free from interruption.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_206">Cards were accordingly proposed, but Mrs. Selby observed that her little daughter, who still complained of her scalded finger, needed amusement as much as any of the company.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_207">In place of cards, Miss Harriet insisted on the "game of the goose."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_208">Down to it we sat, and to a stranger it would have been not unamusing to see Mr. Fleetwood, with his sorrowful countenance, at the "royal and pleasant game of the goose," with a child of seven years old.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_209">It is unnecessary to dwell longer on particulars.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_210">During all the time we were at Mr. Selby's the delighted parents were indulging their fondness, while Mr. Fleetwood was repining and fretting in secret.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_252">, if this was not Mr. Homespun's; and, in the same breath, whether the ladies were at home.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_253">I told him my name was Homespun, the house was mine, and my wife and daughters were, I believed, within.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_254">Upon this, the young man, pulling off his hat, and begging my pardon for calling me</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_255">honest</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_259">I hope your lady and all the family are well."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_260">"Very much at your service, ma'am," he replied, with a low bow; "my lady sent me before, with the offer of her best compliments, and that, if convenient"—and so forth, repeating his words to me.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_261">"She does us infinite honour," said my young madam; "let her ladyship know how happy her visit will make us; but, in the meantime, Mr. Papillot, give your horse to one of the servants, and come in and have a glass of something after your ride."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_262">"I am afraid," answered he (pulling out his right-hand watch, for, would you believe it, sir, the fellow had one in each fob), "I shall hardly have time to meet my lady at the place she appointed me."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_263">On a second invitation, however, he dismounted, and went into the house, leaving his horse to the care of the servants; but the servants, as my daughter very well knew, were all in the fields at work; so I, who have a liking for a good horse, and cannot bear to see him neglected, had the honour of putting Mr. Papillot's horse in the stable myself.'</span>
