<span id="SENTENCE_2">The last story reprinted in this series is 'The Fatal Boots,' which appears without any pictures, the artist and author modestly declaring that, as this edifying narrative originally appeared with George Cruikshank's illustrations (in the 'Comic Almanack' for 1839), he is not inclined to provoke comparisons between the works of that eminent designer and his own.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
<span id="SENTENCE_3">Allusions to caricature-drawing are frequent throughout Thackeray's works, and he delighted to bring the young art-amateur on his scenes.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_4">With pencil as with pen, he had the power of carrying the mind back to the days of the early essayists, and his reconstructive skill is remarkable when he draws the picture of the times in which his rich fancy and his taste for antiquarian completeness found the most delightful materials.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_5">We follow the artist's quaint vein of humour and realism from the little sketches of chivalry—the heroes of knight-errantry,</span>
<a id="Page_453" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="453">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_6">Crusaders, Saracens, and the more romantic personages—which amused him in his boyhood, to his spirited studies illustrative of the days when Dick Steele's 'Tatler' was beginning to be talked about as a paper which contained a very unusual amount of entertainment, from its whimsical combination of sterling wit and truth to nature.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_7">Thackeray was peculiarly at home in the times of Queen Anne.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_8">We find his pencil busy reproducing the figures of personages who moved in the world under the early Georges; and the reign of the third George was as intimately familiar to him, in all details of value, as if he had lived through</span>

<a id="Page_455" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="455">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_9">the triumphs, struggles, and disasters in which his own writings revive a stronger interest.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_10">We enjoy his researches through the great eras of England's history, when Washington led the revolted colonies to independence, when Pitt and Toryism waged war in the Senate with Fox and the friends of liberty, when the fever of Revolution arose in France, and threatened to infect our own land, and when the 'Corsican' was driven down to the death.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_11">Waterloo had a strong claim on Thackeray's interest; he is partial to alluding to the critical point of our history, as all the reading world well knows.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_12">It must be conceded that the chief incident of 'Vanity Fair' leads up to the great battle.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_13">References to the famous field occur in many portions of his gossip or travels, while figures are borrowed from this event to carry out the arguments of his novels and lesser essays under all sorts of circumstances.</span>

</div>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_14">Even in 'Philip,' which deals with a later period, we are carried back to that stirring epoch.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_15">For instance, there is that disreputable old Gann, the tipsy father of Mrs. Brandon, whose acquaintance we made originally in the 'Shabby Genteel Story.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_16">It was always a matter of doubt how this worthy came by his rank of Captain, which was supposed to have had its rise somehow in connection</span>
<a id="Page_456" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="456">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_17">with the Spanish Legion; but, at all events, he had borne the distinction so long, that none of his friends dreamt of investigating the title.</span>

</div>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_18">The costume affected by 'bucks,' when Thackeray was a young man of fashion, comes down to us as preserved in his sketches as something very modish and singular, in which the taste and style seem nearly as quaint and distant as the knee breeches and square skirts of the last century.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_19">'Titmarsh,' who had the courage to dedicate the 'Paris Sketch-Book' to a generous French tailor, was himself an authority on dress; and, although above all pretensions to 'faddery and foppery,' was accustomed to scrutinise closely not only men, but the habits they wore.</span>
<a id="Page_457" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="457">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_20">The reader may confirm what we have just said, if he will turn to the vigorous and whimsical articles on 'Men and Coats,' which Thackeray penned in his younger days.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_21">There is a fine specimen of freedom and independence of convention in many of Thackeray's early writings, especially in those slashing, downright papers which Titmarsh contributed to the magazines, chiefly from the French capital, about the 'Paris Sketch-Book' period.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_27">Criticising the paintings in the Louvre in a paper on 'Men and Pictures,' we find the young art-student riding an audacious tournament against conventionalisms.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_28">He takes very candid exception to the practice of surrounding the heads of translated beings, and particularly angels, with an invariable halo of gold leaf.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_29">He happens to remember that stage tradition was always wont to dress</span>
<a id="Page_460" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="460">

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_59">Another aspect in which it is agreeable to contemplate Thackeray is that of a traveller, for in this character he must have gone over a considerable portion of the more interesting parts of the world.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_60">From India to England, in his seventh year, with that memorable call at St. Helena, where the youngster caught a fugitive glimpse of the great Napoleon in his solitary exile.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_69">It might be an amusing study to reproduce from its pages the attractions of Paris in 1827, the date of the fifteenth edition of this work; but the stout square little book possesses a stronger interest, as it had the advantage of belonging to Michael Angelo Titmarsh, and in his pocket it probably tumbled and tossed across the Channel.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_208">The great event of the last few years of Thackeray's life was the starting of the 'Cornhill Magazine,' the first number of which, with the date of January 1860, appeared shortly before Christmas in the previous year.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_209">The great success which Charles Dickens had met with in conducting his weekly periodical perhaps first suggested the project of this new monthly magazine, with Thackeray for editor.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_210">But few expected a design so bold and original as they found developed by the appearance of Number 1.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_211">The contents were by contributors of first-rate excellence; the</span>
<a id="Page_489" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="489">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_212">quantity of matter in each was equal to that given by the old-established magazines published at half-a-crown, while the price of the 'Cornhill,' as everyone knows, was only a shilling.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_213">The editor's ideas on the subject of the new periodical were explained by him some weeks before the commencement in a characteristic letter to his friend, G. H. Lewes, which was afterwards adopted as the vehicle of announcing the design to the public.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_214">The first number contained the commencement of that series of 'Roundabout Papers' in which we get so many interesting glimpses of Thackeray's personal history and feelings, and also the opening chapters of his story of 'Lovel the Widower.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_215">The latter was originally written in the form of a comedy, entitled 'the Wolf and the Lamb,' which was intended to be performed during the management of Wigan at the Olympic Theatre, but was finally declined by the latter.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_216">Thackeray, we believe, acquiesced in the unfavourable judgment of the practical manager upon the acting qualities of his comedy, and resolved to throw it into narrative form, in the story with which his readers are now familiar.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_217">This was not the first instance of his writing for the stage.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_218">If we are not mistaken, the libretto of John Barnett's popular opera of the 'Mountain Sylph,' produced nearly forty years since, was from his pen.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_219">In the 'Cornhill' also appeared his story of 'Philip on his Way through the World.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_220">The scenes in this are said to have been founded in great part upon his own experiences; and there can be no doubt that the adventures of Philip Firmin represent, in many respects, those of the Charterhouse boy who afterwards became known to the world as the author of 'Vanity Fair.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_221">But in all such matters it is to be remembered that the writer of fiction feels himself at liberty to deviate from the facts of his life in any way which he finds necessary for the development of his story.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_222">Certainly the odious stepfather of Philip must not be taken for Thackeray's portrait of his own stepfather, towards whom he always entertained feelings of respect and affection.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_223">We may also remind our readers that the 'Lectures on the Four Georges' first appeared in print in the 'Cornhill.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_224">The sales reached by the earlier numbers were enormous, and far beyond anything ever attained by a monthly magazine; even after the</span>
<a id="Page_490" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="490">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_225">usual subsidence which follows the flush of a great success, the circulation had, we believe, settled at a point far exceeding the most sanguine hopes of the projectors.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_226">These fortunate results of the undertaking were, however, not without serious drawbacks.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_227">The editor soon discovered that his new position was in many respects an unenviable one.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_228">Friends and acquaintances, not to speak of constant readers and 'regular subscribers to your interesting magazine,' sent him bushels of manuscripts, amongst which it was rare indeed to find one that could be accepted.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_229">Sensitive poets and poetesses took umbrage at refusals, however kindly and delicately expressed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_230">'How can I go into society with comfort?' asked the editor of a friend at this time.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_231">'I dined the other day at ——'s, and at the table were four gentlemen whose masterpieces of literary art I had been compelled to decline with thanks.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_232">Not six months had elapsed before he began to complain of 'thorns' in the editorial cushion.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_233">One lady wrote to entreat that her article might be inserted, on the ground that she had known better days, and had a sick and widowed mother to maintain; others began with fine phrases about the merits and eminent genius of the person they were addressing.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_234">Some found fault with articles, and abused contributor and editor.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_235">An Irishman threatened proceedings for an implied libel in 'Lovel the Widower' upon ballet-dancers, whom he declared to be superior to the snarlings of dyspeptic libellers, or the spiteful attacks and</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_236">brutum fulmen</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_237">of ephemeral authors.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_238">This gentleman also informed the editor that theatrical managers were in the habit of speaking good English, possibly better than ephemeral authors.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_239">It was chiefly owing to these causes that Thackeray finally determined to withdraw from the editorship of the magazine, though continuing to contribute to it and take an interest in its progress.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_240">In an amusing address to contributors and correspondents, dated March 18, 1862, he made known this determination; and in the same address he announced that, while the tale of 'Philip' had been passing through the press, he had been preparing another, on which he had worked at intervals for many years past, and which he hoped to introduce in the following year.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_242">In a pecuniary sense the 'Cornhill Magazine' had undoubtedly proved a fortunate venture for its editor.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_243">It was during his editorship that he removed from his house, No. 36 Onslow Square,</span>
<a id="Page_491" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="491">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_244">in which he had resided for some years, to the more congenial neighbourhood of the Palace at Kensington, that 'Old Court Suburb' which Leigh Hunt has gossiped about so pleasantly.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_245">Thackeray took upon a long lease a somewhat dilapidated mansion, on the west side of Kensington Palace Gardens.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_246">His intention was to repair and improve it, but he finally resolved to pull it down and build another in its stead.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_247">The new house, a handsome, solid mansion of choice red brick with stone facings, was built from a design drawn by himself; and in this house he continued to reside till the time of his death.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_248">'It was,' says Hannay, 'a dwelling worthy of one who really represented literature in the great world, and who, planting himself on his books, yet sustained the character of his profession with all the dignity of a gentleman.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_249">A friend who called on him there from Edinburgh, in the summer of 1862, knowing of old his love of the Venusian, playfully reminded him of what Horace says of those who, regardless of their sepulchre, employ themselves in building houses:</span>
</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i3">
<span id="SENTENCE_250">Sepulchri</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_251">Immemor struis domos.</span>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
<a id="Page_492" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="492">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_252">"Nay," said he, "I am</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_253">memor sepulchri</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_254">, for this house will always let for so many hundreds (mentioning the sum) a year."' We may add that Thackeray was always of opinion that, notwithstanding the somewhat costly proceeding of pulling down and re-erecting, he had achieved the rare result, for a private gentleman, of building for himself a house which, regarded as an investment of a portion of his fortune, left no cause for regret.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_255">Our narrative draws to a close.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_256">The announcement of the death of Thackeray, coming so suddenly upon us in the very midst of our great Christian festival of 1863, caused a shock which will be long remembered.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_257">His hand had been missed in the last two numbers of the 'Cornhill Magazine,' but only because he had been engaged in laying the foundation of another of those continuous works of fiction which his readers so eagerly expected.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_258">In the then current number of the 'Cornhill Magazine' the customary orange-coloured fly-leaf had announced that 'a new serial story' by him would be commenced early in the new year; but the promise had scarcely gone abroad when we learnt that the hand which had penned its opening chapters, in the full prospect of a happy ending, could never again add line or word to that long range of writings which must always remain one of the best evidences of the strength and beauty of our English speech.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_259">On the Tuesday preceding he had followed to the grave his relative, Lady Rodd, widow of Vice-Admiral Sir John Tremayne Rodd, K.C.B., who was the daughter of Major James Rennell, F.R.S., Surveyor-General of Bengal, by the daughter of the Rev. Dr. Thackeray, Head Master of Harrow School.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_260">Only the day before this, according to a newspaper account, he had been congratulating himself on having finished four numbers of a new novel; he had the manuscript in his pocket, and with a boyish frankness showed the last pages to a friend, asking him to read them and see what he could make of them.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_261">When he had completed four numbers more he said he would subject himself to the skill of a very clever surgeon, and be no more an invalid.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_262">Only two days before he had been seen at his club in high spirits; but with all his high spirits, he did not seem well; he complained of illness; but he was often ill, and he laughed off his present attack.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_263">He said that he was about to undergo some treatment which would work a perfect cure in his system, and so he made light of</span>
<a id="Page_493" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="493">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_264">his malady.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_265">He was suffering from two distinct complaints, one of which had now wrought his death.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_266">More than a dozen years before, while he was writing 'Pendennis,' the publication of that work was stopped by his serious illness.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_267">He was brought to death's door, and he was saved from death by Dr. Elliotson, to whom, in gratitude, he dedicated the novel when he lived to finish it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_268">But ever since that ailment he had been subject every month or six weeks to attacks of sickness, attended with violent retching.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_269">He was congratulating himself, just before his death, on the failure of his old enemy to return, and then he checked himself, as if he ought not to be too sure of a release from his plague.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_270">On the morning of Wednesday, December 23, the complaint returned, and he was in great suffering all day.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_271">He was no, better in the evening, and his valet, Charles Sargent, left him at eleven o'clock on Wednesday night, Thackeray wishing him 'Good night' as he went out of the room.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_272">At nine o'clock on the following morning the valet, entering his master's chamber as usual, found him lying on his back quite still, with his arms spread over the coverlet; but he took no notice, as he was accustomed to see his master thus after one of his severe attacks.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_273">He brought some coffee and set it down beside the bed; and it was only when he returned after an interval, and found that the cup had not been tasted, that a sudden alarm seized him, and he discovered that his master was dead.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_274">About midnight Thackeray's mother, who slept overhead, had heard him get up and walk about the room; but she was not alarmed, as this was a habit of her son when unwell.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_275">It is supposed that he had, in fact, been seized at this time, and that the violence of the attack had brought on the effusion on the brain which, as the</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_276">post-mortem</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_277">examination showed, was the immediate cause of death.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_278">His medical attendants attributed his death to effusion on the brain, and added that he had a very large brain, weighing no less than 58½ oz.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_279">Thus, in the full maturity of his powers, died William Makepeace Thackeray, one of the closest observers of human nature, the most kindly of English humourists; and his death has left a blank in our literature, which we, in the present generation at least, are offered no prospect of seeing filled up.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_280">To quote once more his friend Hannay's words: 'It is long since England has lost such a son; it will be long before she has such another</span>
<a id="Page_494" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="494">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_281">to lose.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_282">He was indeed emphatically English—English as distinct from Scotch, no less than English as distinct from Continental.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_283">The highest, purest English novelist since Fielding, he combined Addison's love of virtue, with Johnson's hatred of cant; Horace Walpole's lynx eye for the mean and ridiculous, with the gentleness and wide charity for mankind, as a whole, of Goldsmith.</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_284">Non omnis mortuus est.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_285">He will be remembered in his succession with these men for ages to come, as long as the hymn of praise rises in the old Abbey of Westminster, and wherever the English tongue is native to men, from the banks of the Ganges to those of the Mississippi.'</span>
