<span id="SENTENCE_0">'But this worthy and ingenious squire was very well served by an officer of the army at a horse race here.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_1">They were drinking, among other company, the King's health, at the door of a public-house, on horseback; the officer, when it came to his turn, drank it to this Doughty Highflyer, who happened to be next to him, upon which he made some difficulty at pledging it, suggesting that public healths should not be proposed in mixed company.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_2">"You</span>
<a id="Page_312" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="312">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_3">would say," says the officer, "if you durst, that a High Churchman would not have his Majesty's health proposed to him at all."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_4">Upon this he swore he was a High Churchman, and was not ashamed of it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_5">"So I guessed," said the officer, "by your disloyalty."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_6">"But, Sir," says the officer, "even disloyalty to your prince need not make you show your ill-breeding in company."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_7">The squire chafed most violently at this, and urged, as a proof of his good breeding, that he had been bred at Oxford.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_8">"So I guessed," says the officer, "by your ignorance."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_9">This nettled the squire to the height, and fired his little soul at the expense of the outer case, for he proceeded to give ill words, and to call ill names; but the officer quickly taught him, by the nose, to hold his tongue, and ask pardon.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_10">Thus it always fares with the High Church in fighting as it does in disputing: she is constantly beaten; and the courage and understanding of her passive sons tally with each other.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_11">Of Women.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_12">'Some of my fair correspondents have lately reproached me with negligence and indifference to their sex; but if they could know how vain I am of so obliging a reprimand, they would be sensible, too, how little I deserved it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_13">I am not so entirely a statue as to be insensible of the power of beauty, nor so absolutely a woman's creature as to be blind to their little weaknesses, their pretty follies and impertinences.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_14">'It will be necessary to inform my readers that my landlady is an eminent milliner, and a considerable dealer in Flanders lace.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_15">She is one of those whom we call notable women; she has run through the rough and smooth of life, has a very good plain sense of things, and knows the world, as far as she is concerned in it, very well.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_16">I am very much entertained by her company; her discourse is sure to be seasoned with scandal, ancient and modern, which, though the morals and gravity of my character do not</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_18">'If I come in at a time when the shop, which is commodiously situated above stairs, is full of company, I usually place myself in an obscure corner of it, and observe what passes with secret satisfaction.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_19">'Tis pleasant to hear my landlady, by the mere incessancy of tittle-tattle, persuade her pretty customers out of all the understanding that they brought along with them; and on the other side of the counter to see the little bosoms pant with irresolution, and swell at the view of trifles, which humour and custom have taught them to call necessary and convenient.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_20">Hard by perhaps stands a customer of inferior quality, a citizen's wife suppose her, who is reduced to the hard necessity of regulating her expenses by her husband's allowance, and is bursting with vexation to know herself stinted to lace of but fifty shillings a yard; whereas if she could rise to three pounds, she might be mistress of a very pretty head, and what she really thinks she need not be ashamed to be seen in.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_21">But for want of this all goes wrong; she hates her superiors, despises her husband, neglects her children, and is ashamed and weary of herself.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_22">'This seems ridiculous to my men readers, and it certainly is so; but are our follies and extravagances more reasonable?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_23">Or, rather, are they not infinitely more dangerous and destructive?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_24">What violences do we not commit upon our consciences for the mere gratification of our avarice?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_25">How much of the real ease and happiness of life do we daily sacrifice to the vanity of ambition?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_26">Is it possible, then, since even the greatest men are but a bigger sort of children, to be seriously angry that women are no more?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_27">If in my old age I am struck with the harmony of a rattle, or long to get astride on a hobby-horse; if I love still to be caressed and flattered, and am delighted with good words and high titles, why should I be angry that my wife and daughters do not play the philosopher, and have not more wit than myself?</span>

<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_30">Titus Livius</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_31">, the Roman historian, is my usual entertainment, when I don't find myself disposed for closer application.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_32">Happening to come home sooner than ordinary two nights ago, I took it up, and read the 8th and following chapters of his 39th book, where he gives us a large account of some nocturnal assemblies lately set up at Rome; I think he calls them</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_33">Bacchanals</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_34">, and describes the ceremonies, rites of initiation, and religious practices, together with their music, singing, shrieks, and howlings.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_35">The men were dressed like satyrs, and raved like persons distracted, with enthusiastic motions of the head and violent distortions of the body.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_36">The ladies ran with their hair about their ears and burning torches in their hands; some covered with the skins of panthers, others with those of tigers, all attended with drums and trumpets, while they themselves were the most noisy.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_37">"To this diversion," says the historian, "were added the pleasures of feasting and wine to draw the more in; and when wine, the night, and a mixed company of men and women, jumbled together, had extinguished all sense of shame, there were extravagances of all sorts committed; each having that pleasure ready prepared for him to which his nature was most inclined."</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_42">These frightful appearances put me into such uncommon agitations of body, and I looked so ghastly at my first waking, that a friend of mine, who came early in the morning to make me a visit, was struck with such a terror at the sight of me, that he made to the street door as fast he could, where he had only time to bid one of my servants run for a physician immediately, for he was sure I was going mad.'</span>

<p class="ch_summ">
<span id="SENTENCE_75">Characteristic Passages from the Works of The 'Humourists,' from Thackeray's Library, illustrated by the Author's hand, with Marginal Sketches suggested by the Text—</span>
<span class="smcap">
<span id="SENTENCE_76">The 'World</span>
</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_77">,' 1753—Introduction—Its Difference from the Earlier Essays—Distinguished Authors who contributed to the 'World'—Paragraphs and Pencillings.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_78">The 'World'—writes Dr. Chalmers, in his historical and biographical preface to this series—differs from its predecessors in the general plan, although the ultimate tendency is similar.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_79">We have here no philosophy of morals, no indignant censure of the grosser vices, no critical disquisitions, and, in general, scarcely anything serious.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_80">Irony is the predominant feature.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_81">This caustic species of wit is employed in the 'World' to execute purposes which other methods had failed to accomplish.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_82">The authors of these essays affected to consider the follies of their day as beneath their notice, and therefore tried what good might be done by turning them into ridicule, under the mask of defence or apology, and thus ingeniously demonstrated that every defence of what is in itself absurd and wrong, must either partake of the ridiculous, or be intolerable and repugnant to common sense and reason.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_83">With such intentions, notwithstanding their apparent good humour, they may, perhaps, in the apprehension of many readers, appear more severe censors of the foibles of the age than any who have gone before them.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_84">The design, as professed in the first paper, was to ridicule, with novelty and good humour, the fashions, foibles, vices, and absurdities of that part of the human species which calls itself 'The World;' and this the principal writers were enabled to execute with facility, from the knowledge incidental to their rank</span>
<a id="Page_319" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="319">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_85">in life, the elevated sphere in which they moved, their intercourse with a part of society not easily accessible to authors in general, and the good sense which prevented them from being blinded by the glare or enslaved by the authority of fashion.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_86">The 'World' was projected by Edward Moore</span>
<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@44563@44563-h@44563-h-19.htm.html#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor pginternal" id="FNanchor_25">
<span id="SENTENCE_87">[25]</span>
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_88">—in conjunction with Robert Dodsley, the eminent publisher of Johnson's 'Dictionary'—who fixed upon the name; and by defraying the expense, and rewarding Moore, became, and for many years continued to be, the sole proprietor of the work.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_89">Edward Moore's abilities, his modest demeanour, inoffensive manners, and moral conduct, recommended him to the men of genius and learning of the age, and procured him the patronage of Lord Lyttleton, who engaged his friends to assist him in the way which a man not wholly dependent would certainly prefer.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_90">Dodsley, the publisher, stipulated to pay Moore three guineas for every paper of the 'World' which he should write, or which might be sent for publication and approved of.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_91">Lord Lyttleton, to render this bargain effectual, and an easy source of emolument to his</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_92">protégé</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_93">, solicited the assistance of such men as are not often found willing to contribute the labours of the pen, men of high rank in the state, and men of fame and fashion, who cheerfully undertook to supply the paper, while Moore reaped the emolument, and perhaps for a time enjoyed the reputation of the whole.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_94">But when it became known, as the information soon circulated in whispers, that such men as the Earls of Chesterfield, Bath, and Cork—that Horace Walpole, Richard Owen Cambridge, and Soame Jenyns—besides other persons of both distinction and parts—were leagued in a scheme of authorship to amuse the town, and that the 'World' was the bow of Ulysses, in which it was 'the fashion for men of rank and genius to try their strength,' we may easily suppose that it would excite the curiosity of the public in an uncommon degree.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_95">The first paper was published January 24, 1753; it was consequently contemporary with the 'Adventurer,' which began November 7, 1752; but as the 'World' was published only once</span>
<a id="Page_320" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="320">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_96">a week, it outlived the 'Adventurer' nearly two years, during which time it ran its course also with the 'Connoisseur.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_97">It was of the same size and type and at the same price with the 'Rambler' and 'Adventurer,' but the sale in numbers was superior to either.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_98">In No. 3, Lord Chesterfield states that the number sold weekly was two thousand, which number, he adds, 'exceeds the largest that was ever printed, even of the "Spectator."' In No. 49, he hints that 'not above</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_99">three</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_100">thousand were sold.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_101">The sale was probably not regular, and would be greater on the days when rumour announced his lordship as the writer.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_102">The usual number printed was two thousand five hundred, as stated in a letter from Moore to Dr. Warton.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_103">Notwithstanding the able assistance of his right honourable friends, Moore wrote sixty-one of these papers, and part of another.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_104">He excelled principally in assuming the serious manner for the purposes of ridicule, or of raising idle curiosity; his irony is admirably concealed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_105">However trite his subject, he enlivens it by original turns of thought.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_106">In the last paper, the conclusion of the work is made to depend on a fictitious accident which is supposed to have happened to the author and occasioned his death.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_107">When the papers were collected in volumes, Moore superintended the publication, and actually died while this last paper was in the press: a circumstance somewhat singular, when we look at the contents of it, and which induces us to wish that death may be less frequently included among the topics of wit.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_108">It has been the general opinion, for the honour of rank, that the papers written by men of that description in the 'World' are superior to those of Moore, or of his assistants of 'low degree.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_109">It may be conceded that among the contributories the first place is due, in point of genius, taste, and elegance, to the pen of Philip Dormer Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_110">Lord Chesterfield's services to this paper were purely voluntary, but a circumstance occurred to his first communication which had nearly disinclined him to send a second.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_111">He sent his paper to the publisher without any notice of its authorship; it underwent a casual inspection, and, from its length, was at least delayed, if not positively rejected.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_112">Fortunately Lord Lyttleton saw it at Dodsley's, and knew the hand.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_113">Moore then hastened to publish the paper (No. 18), and thought proper to introduce it with an</span>
<a id="Page_321" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="321">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_114">apology for the delay, and a neat compliment to the wit and good sense of his correspondent.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_115">Chesterfield continued his papers occasionally, and wrote in all twenty-three numbers, certainly equal, if not superior, in brilliancy of wit and novelty of thought, to the most popular productions of this kind.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_116">A certain interest surrounds most of the authors who assisted in the 'World,' and many of the papers were written under circumstances which increase the attraction of their contents.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_117">We have not space to particularise special essays, or to enter upon the biographical details which properly belong to our subject; we must restrict further notice to a mere recapitulation of the contributors and their pieces.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_118">Richard Owen Cambridge, the author of the 'Scribleriad,' wrote in all twenty-one papers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_119">Horace Walpole was the author of nine papers in the 'World,' all of which excel in keen satire, shrewd remark, easy and scholarly diction, and knowledge of mankind; indeed, for sprightly humour these papers probably excel all his other writings, and most of those of his contemporaries.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_120">For five papers we are indebted to Soame Jenyns, who held the office and rank of one of the Lords Commissioners of the Board of Trade and Plantations.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_121">James Tilson, Consul at Cadiz, furnished five papers of considerable merit and novelty.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_122">Five papers, chiefly of the more serious kind, were contributed by Edward Loveybond; the 'Tears of Old May-Day,' No. 82 of the 'World,' is esteemed one of his best poetic compositions.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_123">W. Whitehead, the Poet Laureate, wrote three papers, Nos. 12, 19, and 58.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_124">Nos. 79, 156, 202 were written by Richard Berenger, Gentleman of the Horse to the King.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_125">Sir James Marriott, Judge of the High Court of Admiralty, and Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, wrote Nos. 117, 121, 199.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_126">The 'Adventures of the Pumpkin Family,' zealous to defend their honour, given in Nos. 47 and 63, were written by John, Earl of Cork and Orrery, the amiable nobleman who, as Johnson whimsically declared, '</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_127">was so generally civil, that nobody thanked him for it</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_128">.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_129">The Earl of Cork is also said to have contributed Nos. 161 and 185; he took a more active part in the 'Connoisseur.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_130">To his son, Mr. Hamilton Boyle, who afterwards succeeded</span>
<a id="Page_322" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="322">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_131">to the earl's title, the 'World' was indebted for Nos. 60 and 170, two papers drawn up with vivacity, humour, and elegance.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_132">William Pulteney, Earl of Bath, to whom the second volume of the 'Guardian' was dedicated, contributed to the 'World,' in his seventy-first year, No. 7, a lively paper on horse-racing and the manners of Newmarket.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_133">Three papers, Nos. 140, 147, and 204, specimens of easy and natural humour, came from the pen of Sir David Dalrymple, better known as Lord Hailes, one of the senators of the College of Justice in Scotland; in advanced life Lord Hailes contributed several papers remarkable for vivacity and point to the 'Mirror.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_134">William Duncombe, a poetical and miscellaneous writer, was the author of the allegory in No. 84; his son, the Rev. John Duncombe, of Canterbury, was the author of No. 36.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_135">The latter gentleman appears in connection with the 'Connoisseur.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_136">Nos. 38 and 74 were written by Mr. Parratt, the author of some poems in Dodsley's collection.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_137">Nos. 78 and 86 are from the pen of the Rev. Thomas Cole.</span>
</p>

<span id="SENTENCE_313">'Sir Josiah was scarce nineteen years old when he was introduced at the Court of Charles the Second, by his uncle Sir Simon Sparrowgrass, who was at that time Lancaster herald-at-arms, and in great favour at Whitehall.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_314">'As soon as he had kissed the King's hand, he was presented to the Duke of York, and immediately afterwards to the ministers and the mistresses.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_315">His fortune, which was considerable, and his manners, which were elegant, made him so very acceptable in all companies, that he had the honour to be plunged at once into every polite party of wit, pleasure, and expense, that the courtiers could possibly display.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_316">He danced with the ladies, he drank with the gentlemen, he sang loyal catches, and broke bottles and glasses in every tavern throughout London.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_317">But still he was by no means a perfect fine gentleman.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_318">He had not fought a</span>
<span class="smcap">
<span id="SENTENCE_319">DUEL</span>
</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_320">.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_321">He was so extremely unfortunate as never to have had even the happiness of a</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_322">rencontre</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_323">.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_324">The want of opportunity, not of courage, had occasioned this inglorious chasm in his character.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_325">He appeared, not only to the whole court, but even in his own eye, an unworthy and degenerate Pumpkin, till he had shown himself as expert in opening a vein with a sword as any surgeon in England could be with a lancet.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_326">Things remained in this unhappy situation till he was near two-and-twenty years of age.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_327">'At length his better stars prevailed, and he received a most egregious affront from Mr. Cucumber, one of the gentlemen-ushers of the privy-chamber.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_328">Cucumber, who was in waiting at court, spit inadvertently into the chimney, and as he stood next to Sir Josiah Pumpkin, part of the spittle rested upon Sir Josiah's shoe.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_329">It was then that the true Pumpkin honour arose in blushes upon his cheeks.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_330">He turned upon his heel, went home immediately, and sent Mr. Cucumber a challenge.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_331">Captain Daisy, a friend to</span>
<a id="Page_332" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="332">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_332">each party, not only carried the challenge, but adjusted preliminaries.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_333">The heroes were to fight in Moorfields, and to bring fifteen seconds on a side.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_334">Punctuality is a strong instance of valour upon these occasions; the clock of St. Paul's struck seven just when the combatants were marking out their ground, and each of the two-and-thirty gentlemen was adjusting himself into a posture of defence against his adversary.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_335">It happened to be the hour for breakfast in the hospital of Bedlam.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_336">A small bell had rung to summon the Bedlamites into the great gallery.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_337">The keepers had already unlocked the cells, and were bringing forth their mad folks, when the porter of Bedlam, Owen Macduffy, standing at the iron gate, and beholding such a number of armed men in the fields, immediately roared out, "Fire, murder, swords, daggers, bloodshed!"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_338">Owen's voice was always remarkably loud, but his fears had rendered it still louder and more tremendous.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_339">His words struck a panic into the keepers; they lost all presence of mind, they forgot their prisoners, and hastened most precipitately down stairs to the scene of action.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_340">At the sight of the naked swords their fears increased, and at once they stood open-mouthed and motionless.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_341">Not so the lunatics; freedom to madmen and light to the blind are equally rapturous.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_342">Ralph Rogers, the tinker, began the alarm.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_343">His brains had been turned with joy at the Restoration, and the poor wretch imagined that this glorious set of combatants were Roundheads and Fanatics, and accordingly he cried out, "Liberty and property, my boys!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_344">Down with the Rump!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_345">Cromwell and Ireton are come from hell to destroy us.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_346">Come, my Cavalier lads, follow me, and let us knock out their brains."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_347">The Bedlamites immediately obeyed, and, with the tinker at their head, leaped over the balusters of the staircase, and ran wildly into the fields.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_348">In their way they picked up some staves</span>
<a id="Page_333" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="333">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_349">and cudgels, which the porters and the keepers had inadvertently left behind, and, rushing forward with amazing fury, they forced themselves outrageously into the midst of the combatants, and in one unlucky moment disturbed all the decency and order with which this most illustrious duel had begun.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_350">'It seemed, according to my grandfather's observation, a very untoward fate that two-and-thirty gentlemen of courage, honour, fortune, and quality should meet together in hopes of killing each other with all that resolution and politeness which belonged to their stations, and should at once be routed, dispersed, and even wounded by a set of madmen, without sword, pistol, or any other more honourable weapon than a cudgel.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_351">'The madmen were not only superior in strength, but numbers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_352">Sir Josiah Pumpkin and Mr. Cucumber stood their ground as long as possible, and they both endeavoured to make the lunatics the sole object of their mutual revenge; but the two friends were soon overpowered, and, no person daring to come to their assistance, each of them made as proper a retreat as the place and circumstances would admit.</span>
