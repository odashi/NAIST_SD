<span id="SENTENCE_0">'I had not waited two hours before I was called up, and found Mr. Courtly and his lady at piquet in the height of good humour.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_1">This I looked on as a favourable sign, and stood at the lower end of the room, in expectation of the common questions.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_2">At last Mr. Courtly called out, after a whisper, "Stand facing the light, that one may see you."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_3">I changed my place, and blushed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_4">They frequently turned their eyes upon me, and seemed to discover many subjects of merriment, for at every look they whispered, and laughed with the most violent agitations of delight.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_5">At last Mr. Courtly cried out, "Is that colour your own, child?"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_6">"Yes," said the lady, "if she has not robbed the kitchen hearth."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_7">It was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of laughter, and they threw down their cards in hopes of better sport.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_8">The lady then called me to her, and began with affected gravity to inquire what I could do.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_9">"But first turn about, and let us see your fine shape; well, what are you fit for, Mrs. Mum?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_10">You would find your tongue, I suppose, in the kitchen."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_11">"No, no," says Mrs. Courtly, "the girl's a good girl yet, but I am afraid a brisk young fellow, with fine tags on his shoulder——" "Come, child, hold up your head; what? you have stole nothing."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_12">"Not yet," said the lady; "but she hopes to steal your heart quickly."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_13">Here was a laugh of happiness and triumph, prolonged by the confusion which I could no longer repress.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_14">At last the lady recollected herself: "Stole? no—but if I had her I should watch her; for that downcast eye——Why cannot you look people in the face?"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_15">"Steal!" says her husband, "she would steal nothing but, perhaps, a few ribbons before they were left off by my lady."</span>
<a id="Page_379" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="379">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_16">"Sir," answered I, "why should you, by supposing me a thief, insult one from whom you have received no injury?"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_17">"Insult!" says the lady; "are you come here to be a servant, you saucy baggage, and talk of insulting?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_18">What will this world come to if a gentleman may not jest with a servant?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_19">Well, such servants! pray be gone, and see when you will have the honour to be so insulted again.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_20">Servants insulted—a fine time!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_21">Insulted!</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_26">'There is no observation more frequently made by such as employ themselves in surveying the conduct of mankind than that marriage, though the dictate of nature, and the institute of Providence, is yet very often the cause of misery, and that those who enter into that state can seldom forbear to express their repentance, and their envy of those whom either chance or caution hath withheld from it.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_27">'One of the first of my acquaintances that resolved to quit the unsettled, thoughtless condition of a bachelor was Prudentius, a man of slow parts, but not without knowledge or judgment in things which he had leisure to consider gradually before he determined them.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_28">This grave considerer found by deep meditation that a man was no loser by marrying early, even though he contented himself with a less fortune, for, estimating the exact worth of annuities, he found that considering the constant diminution of the value of life, with the probable fall of the interest of money, it was not worse to have ten thousand pounds at the age of two-and-twenty years than a much larger fortune at thirty; for many opportunities, says he, occur of improving money which, if a man misses, he may not afterwards recover.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_29">'Full of these reflections, he threw his eyes about him, not in search of beauty or elegance, dignity or understanding, but of a woman with ten thousand pounds.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_30">Such a woman, in a wealthy part of the kingdom, it was not difficult to find; and by artful management with her father—whose ambition was to make his daughter a gentlewoman—my friend got her, as he boasted to us</span>
<a id="Page_380" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="380">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_31">in confidence two days after his marriage, for a settlement of seventy-three pounds a year less than her fortune might have claimed, and less than himself would have given if the fools had been but wise enough to delay the bargain.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_32">'Thus at once delighted with the superiority of his parts and the augmentation of his fortune, he carried Furia to his own house, in which he never afterwards enjoyed one hour of happiness.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_33">For Furia was a wretch of mean intellects, violent passions, a strong voice, and low education, without any sense of happiness but that which consisted in eating, and counting money.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_34">Furia was a scold.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_35">They agreed in the desire of wealth, but with this difference: that Prudentius was for growing rich by gain, Furia by parsimony.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_36">Prudentius would venture his money with chances very much in his favour; but Furia, very wisely observing that what they had was, while they had it,</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_37">their own</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_38">, thought all traffic too great a hazard, and was for putting it out at low interest upon good security.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_39">Prudentius ventured, however, to insure a ship at a very unreasonable price; but, happening to lose his money, was so tormented with the clamours of his wife that he never durst try a second experiment.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_40">He has now grovelled seven-and-forty years under Furia's direction, who never once mentioned him, since his bad luck, by any other name than that of the "usurer."'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_58">Eupheues has turned on his exterior appearance that attention which would have always produced esteem had it been fixed upon his mind; and, though his virtues and abilities have preserved him from the contempt which he has so diligently solicited, he has at least raised one impediment to his reputation, since all can judge of his dress, but few of his understanding, and many who discern that he is a fop are unwilling to believe that he can be wise.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_73">The 'Rambler' inserts a letter describing how the end of those ladies whose chief ambition is to please is often missed by absurd and injudicious endeavours to obtain distinction, and who mistake cowardice for elegance, and imagine all delicacy consists in refusing to be pleased.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_74">A country gentleman relates the circumstances of his visit to</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_75">Anthea</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_76">, a heiress, whose birth and beauty render her a desirable match:—</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_77">'Dinner was now over, and the company proposed that we should pursue our original design of visiting the gardens.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_78">Anthea declared that she could not imagine what pleasure we expected from the sight of a few green trees and a little gravel, and two or three pits of clear water; that, for her part, she hated walking till the cool of the evening, and thought it very likely to rain, and again wished she had stayed at home.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_79">We then reconciled ourselves to our disappointment, and began to talk on common subjects, when Anthea told us since we came to see the gardens she would not hinder our satisfaction.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_80">We all rose, and walked through the enclosures for some time with no other trouble than the necessity of watching lest a frog should hop across the way, which, Anthea told us, would certainly kill her if she should happen to see him.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_81">'Frogs, as it fell out, there were none; but when we were within a furlong of the gardens Anthea saw some sheep, and heard the wether clink his bell, which she was certain was not hung upon him for nothing, and therefore no assurances nor entreaties</span>
<a id="Page_383" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="383">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_82">should prevail upon her to go a step further: she was sorry to disappoint the company, but her life was dearer to her than ceremony.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_83">'We came back to the inn, and Anthea now discovered that there was no time to be lost in returning, for the night would come upon us and a thousand misfortunes might happen in the dark.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_84">The horses were immediately harnessed, and Anthea, having wondered what could seduce her to stay so long, was eager to set out.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_85">But we had now a new scene of terror; every man we saw was a robber, and we were ordered sometimes to drive hard—lest a traveller, whom we saw behind, should overtake us—and sometimes to stop, lest we should come up to him who was passing before us.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_86">She alarmed many an honest man by begging him to spare her life as he passed by the coach, and drew me into fifteen quarrels with persons who increased her fright by kindly stopping to inquire whether they could assist us.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_298">'Of sixty-seven doors at which I knocked in the first week after my appearance in a mourning dress I was denied admission at forty-six; was suffered at fourteen to wait in the outer room till business was despatched; at four was entertained with a few questions about the weather; at one heard the footman rated for bringing my name; and at two was informed, in the flow of casual conversation, how much a man of rank degrades himself by mean company.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_306">'Without knowing for what purpose I was called to my great cousin,' says the unhappy Misella, 'I endeavoured to recommend myself by my best courtesy, sang him my prettiest song, told the last story that I had read, and so much endeared myself by my innocence that he declared his resolution to adopt me, and to educate me with his own daughters.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_310">They considered, not without that false estimation of the value of wealth which poverty long continued always produces, that I was raised to higher rank than they could give me, and to hopes of more ample fortune than they could bequeath.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_311">My mother sold some of her ornaments to dress me in such a manner as might secure me from contempt at my first arrival, and when she dismissed me pressed me to her bosom with an embrace which I still feel.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_312">'My sister carried my finery, and seemed not much to regret our separation; my father conducted me to the stage-coach with a sort of cheerful tenderness; and in a very short time I was transported to splendid apartments and a luxurious table, and grew familiar to show, noise, and gaiety.</span>
