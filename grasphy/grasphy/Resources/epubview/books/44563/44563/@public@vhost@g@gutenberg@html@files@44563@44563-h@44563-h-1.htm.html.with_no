<span id="SENTENCE_4">Think of the plays in fashion between 1820 and '30; what juvenile rejoicings over the moral drama, over the wicked earl unmasked in the last Act, the persecuted maiden triumphant, and virtue's defenders rewarded.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_5">Recall the pieces in vogue in those early days, to which the novelist refers with constant pleasure; how does he write of nautical melodramas, of 'Black Ey'd Seusan,' and such</span>

</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_6">simply constructed pieces as he has parodied in the pages of 'Punch:' such as Theodore Hook is described hitting off on the piano after dinner.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_7">Think of Sadler's Wells, and the real water, turned on from the New River adjacent.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_9">How faded are all these glories in our time, yet they were gorgeous subjects for young Thackeray's hand to work out; and we can well conceive eager little Cistercians, in miniature black gowns and breeches, revelling over the splendid pictures, perhaps made more glorious with the colour box.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_63">The references made by Thackeray to the romances which thrilled the sympathies of novel-readers in his youth are spread throughout his writings.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_64">In the 'Roundabout Paper' devoted to reminiscences of fictions which delighted his schooldays, he whimsically deplores that Time, among other insatiable propensities, should devour the glories of novels, and especially of those which have befriended his youth; that no friendly hand should take the volumes down from their long rest on the library shelves; that the profits of the forlorn novelists should dwindle infinitesimally as the popularity of their bantlings fades, until limbo finally takes them into indefinite keeping.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_65">In another paper, 'De Juventate,' he makes an earlier record of his partiality for the imaginary companions of his boyhood.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_66">After alluding to the games of his time, which he finds little changed, Mr. Roundabout reverts to his favourite old novels, and challenges the present day to rival their attractions, as far as his boyish imagination was concerned.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_67">'O "Scottish Chiefs," didn't we weep over you?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_68">O "Mysteries of Udolpho," didn't I and Briggs minor draw pictures out of you, as I have said?'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_69">On the title-page of one of his old class-books, 'The Eton Latin Grammar,' we find fanciful scribblings, in the manner of</span>
<a id="Page_19" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="19">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_70">Skelt's once famous theatrical characters, of schoolboy versions of Sir William Wallace triumphing over the fallen Sir Aymer de Valence, while Thaddeus of Warsaw, attired in a square Polish cap, laced jacket, tights, and Hessian boots, his belt stuck round with pistols, is gallantly flourishing a curly sabre.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_71">Sketches of this picturesque nature seem to have held a certain charm over the novelist's fancy through life; the impressions of his boyhood are jotted down in all sorts of melodramatic fragments.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_72">Similar reminiscences, applying to different stages of our writer's career, and forming portions of the illustrations to 'Thackerayana,' will be recognised throughout this work.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_73">We endeavour to trace sufficient of the thread of the once familiar story of 'The Castle of Otranto' (published in 1782, the fourth edition), enlivened with highly droll marginal pencillings, to assist our readers in a ready appreciation of the point and character of the little designs, as it is more than probable that, by this time, the interest and incidents of the original fiction are somewhat obscured in the memories of our readers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_74">We follow the words of the author as closely as possible.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_75">'Manfred, Prince of Otranto, had one son and one daughter.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_76">The latter, a most beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called Matilda.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_77">Conrad, the son, was only fifteen, and of a sickly constitution; he was the hope of his father, who had contracted a marriage for him with the Marquis of Vicenza's daughter, Isabella.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_78">The bride elect had been delivered by the guardians into Manfred's hands, that the marriage might take place as soon as Conrad's infirm health would permit it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_79">The impatience of the prince for the completion of this ceremonial was attributed to his dread of seeing an ancient prophecy accomplished, which pronounced—"that the Castle and Lordship of Otranto should pass from the present family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it."</span>
</p>
<div class="figcenter">

</div>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_80">'Young Conrad's birthday was fixed for the marriage; the company were assembled in the chapel of the castle, everything ready,—but the bridegroom was missing!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_81">The prince, in alarm, went in search of his son.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_82">The first object that struck Manfred's eyes was a group of his servants endeavouring to raise something</span>
<a id="Page_20" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="20">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_83">that appeared to him a mountain of sable plumes.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_84">"What are ye doing?" he cried, wrathfully; "where is my son?"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_85">A volley of voices replied, "Oh! my lord! the prince! the helmet! the helmet!"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_86">Shocked with these lamentable sounds, and dreading he knew not what, he advanced hastily,—but what a sight for a father's eyes!</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_87">He beheld his child dashed to pieces, and almost buried under an enormous helmet, a hundred times larger than any casque ever made for human being, and shaded with a proportionable quantity of black feathers.</span>
<a id="Page_21" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="21">

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_88">'The consternation produced by this murderous apparition did not diminish.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_89">Isabella was, however, relieved at her escape from an ill-assorted union.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_90">Manfred continued to gaze at the terrible casque.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_91">No one could explain its presence.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_92">In the midst of their senseless guesses, a young peasant, whom rumour had drawn thither from a neighbouring village, observed that the miraculous helmet was like that on the figure in black marble, in the church of St. Nicholas, of Alonzo the Good (the original Prince of Otranto, who died without leaving an ascertained heir, and whose steward, Manfred's grandfather, had illegally contrived to obtain possession of the castle, estates, and title).</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_93">"Villain! what sayest thou?" cried Manfred, starting from his trance in a tempest of rage, and seizing the young man by the collar.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_94">"How darest thou utter such treason?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_95">Thy life shall pay for it!"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_96">The peasant was secured, and confined, as a necromancer, under the gigantic helmet, there to be starved to death.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_97">Manfred retired to his chamber to meditate in solitude over the blow which had descended on his house.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_98">His gentle daughter, Matilda, heard his disordered footsteps.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_99">She was just going to beg admittance, when Manfred suddenly opened the door; and as it was now twilight, concurring with the disorder of his mind, he did not distinguish the person, but asked angrily who it was.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_100">Matilda replied, trembling, "My dearest father, it is I, your daughter."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_101">Manfred, stepping back hastily, cried, "Begone, I do not want a daughter;" and flinging back abruptly, clapped the door against the terrified Matilda.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_102">His dejected daughter returned to her mother, the pious Hippolita, who was being comforted by Isabella.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_103">A servant, on the part of Manfred, informed the latter that Manfred demanded to speak with her.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_104">"With me!" cried Isabella.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_105">"Go," said Hippolita, "console him, and tell</span>
<a id="Page_22" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="22">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_106">him that I will smother my own anguish rather than add to his."</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_107">'As it was now evening, the servant, who conducted Isabella, bore a torch before her.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_108">When they came to Manfred, who was walking impatiently about the gallery, he started, and said hastily, "Take away that light, and begone."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_109">Then, shutting the door impetuously, he flung himself upon a bench against the wall, and bade Isabella sit by him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_110">She obeyed trembling.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_111">The iniquitous Manfred then proposed, that as his son was dead, Isabella should espouse him instead, and he would divorce the virtuous Hippolita.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_112">Manfred, on her refusal, resorted to violence, when the plumes of the fatal helmet suddenly waved to and fro tempestuously in the moonlight.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_113">Manfred, disregarding the portent, cried—"Heaven nor hell shall impede my designs," and advanced to seize the princess.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_114">At that instant the portrait of his grandfather, which hung over the bench where they had been sitting, uttered a deep sigh, and heaved its breast.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_115">Manfred was distracted between his pursuit of Isabella and the aspect of the picture, which quitted its panel and stepped on the floor with a grave and melancholy air.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_116">The vision sighed and made a sign to Manfred to follow him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_117">"Lead on!" cried Manfred; "I will follow thee to the gulph of perdition."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_118">The spectre marched sedately, but dejected, to the end of the gallery.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_119">Manfred followed, full of anxiety and horror, but resolved.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_120">The spectre retired.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_121">Isabella had fled to a subterranean passage leading from the Castle to the Sanctuary of St. Nicholas.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_122">In this vault she encountered the young peasant who had provoked the animosity of Manfred.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_123">He lifted up a secret trap-door, and Isabella made her escape; but Manfred and his followers prevented the flight of the daring stranger.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_124">The prince, who expected to</span>
<a id="Page_23" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="23">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_125">secure Isabella, was considerably startled to discover this youth in her stead.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_126">The weight of the helmet had broken the pavement above, and he had thus alighted in time to assist Isabella, whose disappearance he denied.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_127">A noise of voices startled Manfred, who was alarmed by fresh indications of hostile evidences.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_128">Jacques and Diego, two of his retainers, detailed the fresh cause of alarm.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_129">It was thus: they had heard a noise—they opened a door and ran back, their hair standing on end with terror.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_130">'"It is a giant, I believe," said Diego; "he is all clad in armour, for I saw his foot and part of his leg, and they are as large as the helmet below in the court.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_131">We heard a violent motion, and the rattling of armour, as if the giant was rising.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_132">Before we could get to the end of the gallery we heard the door of the great chamber clap behind us; but for Heaven's sake, good my lord, send for the chaplain and have the place exorcised, for it is certainly haunted."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_133">The attendants searched for Isabella in vain.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_134">The next morning father Jerome arrived, announcing that she had taken refuge at the altar of St. Nicholas.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_135">He came to inform Hippolita of the perfidy of her husband.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_136">Manfred prevented him, saying, "I do not use to let my wife be acquainted with the affairs of my state; they are not within a woman's province."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_137">"My Lord," said the holy man, "I am no intruder into the secrets of families.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_138">My office is to promote peace and teach mankind to curb their headstrong passions.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_140">Hearken to Him who speaks through my organs."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_141">The good father—to divert Manfred by a subterfuge from his unhallowed designs—suggested that there might, perhaps, be an attachment between</span>
<a id="Page_24" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="24">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_142">the peasant and his recluse.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_143">Manfred was so enraged that he ordered the youth who defied him to be executed forthwith.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_144">The removal of the peasant's doublet disclosed the mark of a bloody arrow.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_145">"Gracious Heaven!" cried the priest, starting, "what do I see? it is my child! my Theodore!"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_146">Manfred was deaf to the prayers of the father and friar, and ordered the tragedy to proceed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_147">"A saint's bastard may be no saint himself," said the prince sternly.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_148">The friar exclaimed, "His blood is noble; he is my lawful son, and I am the Count of Falconara!"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_149">At this critical juncture the tramp of horses was heard, the sable plumes of the enchanted helmet were again agitated, and a brazen trumpet was sounded without.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_150">"Father," said Manfred, "do you go to the wicket and demand who is at the gate."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_151">"Do you grant me the life of Theodore?" replied the friar.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_152">"I do," said the prince.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_153">The new arrival was a herald from the Knight of the Gigantic Sabre, who requested to speak with the Usurper of Otranto.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_154">'Manfred was enraged at this message; he ordered Jerome to be thrust out, and to reconduct Isabella to the castle, and commanded Theodore to be confined in the black tower.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_155">He then directed the herald to be admitted to his presence.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_156">'"Well! thou insolent!" said the prince, "what wouldst thou with me?"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_157">"I come," replied he, "to thee, Manfred, usurper of the principality of Otranto, from the renowned and invincible knight, the Knight of the Gigantic Sabre: in the name of his Lord, Frederic, Marquis of Vicenza, he demands the Lady Isabella, daughter of that prince whom thou hast basely and treacherously got into thy power, by bribing her false guardians during his absence; he requires thee to resign the principality of Otranto, which thou hast usurped from the said Lord Frederic, the nearest of blood to the last rightful Lord Alonzo the Good.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_158">If thou dost not instantly comply with these just demands, he defies thee to single combat to the last extremity."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_159">And so saying, the herald cast down his warder.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_160">Manfred knew how well founded this claim was; indeed, his object in seeking an alliance with Isabella had been to unite the claimants in one interest.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_161">'The herald was despatched to bid the champions welcome, and the prince ordered the gates to be flung open for the reception of</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_163">In a few minutes the cavalcade arrived.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_164">First came two harbingers with wands.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_165">Next a herald, followed by two pages and two trumpets.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_166">Then a hundred foot-guards.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_167">These were attended by as many horse.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_168">After them fifty foot-men clothed in scarlet and black, the colours of the knight.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_169">Then a led horse.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_170">Two heralds on each side of a gentleman on horseback bearing a banner with the arms of Vicenza and Otranto quarterly—a circumstance that much offended Manfred, but he stifled his resentment.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_171">Two more pages.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_172">The knight's confessor telling his beads.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_173">Fifty more foot-men clad as before.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_178">The knight himself on a chestnut steed, in complete armour, his lance in the rest, his face entirely concealed by his vizor, which was surmounted by a large plume of scarlet and black feathers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_179">Fifty foot-guards, with drums and trumpets, closed the procession.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_180">Manfred invited the train to enter the great hall of his castle.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_181">He proposed to the stranger to disarm, but the knight shook his head in token of refusal.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_182">"Rest here," said Manfred; "I will but give orders for the accommodation of your train, and return to you."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_183">The three knights bowed as accepting his courtesy.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_184">Manfred directed the stranger's retinue to be conducted to an adjacent hospital, founded by the Princess Hippolita for the reception of pilgrims.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_185">As they made the circuit of the court, the gigantic sword burst from the supporters, and falling to the ground opposite the helmet, remained immovable.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_188">He put several questions to them, but was answered only by signs.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_189">They raised their vizors but sufficiently to feed themselves, and that sparingly.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_193">The gentle Matilda came to his assistance; she carried him to her father's armoury, and having equipped him with a complete suit, conducted him to the postern-gate.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_200">In the caverns Theodore recovered the distracted Isabella; but a knight arrived at the moment of his happy discovery, and mistrusting her deliverer, while Theodore</span>
<a id="Page_27" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="27">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_201">deceived himself as to the intentions of the stranger, a desperate combat ensued, and the younger champion gained the victory.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_202">The stranger knight explained his mistake, and revealed himself as the missing Marquis of Vicenza, father to Isabella, and nearest heir to Alonzo.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_203">He anticipated his wounds were fatal, but he recovered at the castle.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_204">Manfred artfully pursued his unholy designs for a union with Isabella.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_205">He gave a great feast, with this object, but Theodore withdrew from the revelry to pray with Matilda at the tomb of Alonzo.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_206">Manfred followed him to the chapel, believing his companion was Isabella, and struck his dagger through the heart of his daughter.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_207">He was overwhelmed with remorse for his error, on discovering that he had murdered his child.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_208">Theodore</span>
<a id="Page_28" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="28">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_209">revealed to Frederic that he was the real and rightful successor to Alonzo.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_210">This declaration was confirmed by the apparition of Alonzo.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_211">Thunder and a clank of more than mortal armour was heard.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_212">The walls of the castle behind Manfred were thrown down with a mighty force, and the form of Alonzo, dilated to an immense magnitude, appeared in the centre of the ruins.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_213">'Behold in Theodore the true heir of Alonzo!' said the vision, and, ascending solemnly towards heaven, the clouds parted asunder, and the form of St. Nicholas received Alonzo's shade.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_214">Manfred confessed, in his terror, that Alonzo had been poisoned by his grandfather, and a fictitious will had accomplished his treacherous end.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_215">Jerome further revealed that Alonzo had secretly espoused Victoria, a Sicilian virgin.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_216">After the good knight's decease a daughter was born.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_217">Her hand had been bestowed on him, the disguised Count of Falconara.</span>
