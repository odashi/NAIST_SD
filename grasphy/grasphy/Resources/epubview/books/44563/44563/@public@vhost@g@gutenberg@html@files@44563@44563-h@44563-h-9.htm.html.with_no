<span id="SENTENCE_4">The great men make a vast circle at the foot of the altar, standing with their backs to the priests and the holy mysteries, and their faces erected towards their king, who is seen on his knees upon a throne, and to whom they seem to direct the desires of their hearts, and all their devotion.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_55">'This, dear Jenny, is the reason that the quarrel between Sir Harry and his lady, which began about her squirrel, is irreconcilable.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_56">Sir Harry was reading a grave author; she runs into his study, and, in a playing humour, claps the squirrel upon the folio: he threw the animal, in a rage, on the floor; she snatches it up again, calls Sir Harry a sour pedant, without good nature or good manners.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_57">This cast him into such a rage, that he threw down the table before him, kicked the book round the room, then recollected himself: "Lord, madam," said he, "why did you run into such expressions?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_58">I was," said he, "in the highest delight with that author when you clapped your squirrel upon my book;" and smiling, added upon recollection, "I have a great respect for your favourite, and pray let us be all friends."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_59">My lady was so far from accepting this apology, that she immediately conceived a resolution to keep him under for ever, and, with</span>
<a id="Page_245" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="245">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_60">a serious air, replied, "There is no regard to be had to what a man says who can fall into so indecent a rage and an abject submission in the same moment, for which I absolutely despise you."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_61">Upon which she rushed out of the room.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_62">Sir Harry stayed some minutes behind, to think and command himself; after which he followed her into her bed-chamber, where she was prostrate upon the bed, tearing her hair, and naming twenty coxcombs who would have used her otherwise.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_63">This provoked him to so high a degree that he forbade nothing but beating her; and all the servants in the family were at their several stations listening, whilst the best man and woman, the best master and mistress, defamed each other in a way that is not to be repeated even at Billingsgate.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_64">You know this ended in an immediate separation: she longs to return home, but knows not how to do it; and he invites her home every day.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_65">Her husband requires no submission of her; but she thinks her very return will argue she is to blame, which she is resolved to be for ever, rather than acknowledge it.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_70">'When I came home last night, my servant delivered me the following letter:—</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_71">'"Sir,—I have orders from Sir Harry Quickset, of Staffordshire, Baronet, to acquaint you, that his honour, Sir Harry himself; Sir Giles Wheelbarrow, Knight; Thomas Rentfree, Esquire, justice of the quorum; Andrew Windmill, Esquire; and Mr. Nicolas Doubt, of the Inner Temple, Sir Harry's grandson, will wait upon you at the hour of nine to-morrow morning, being Tuesday, the twenty-fifth of October, upon business which Sir Harry will impart to you by word of mouth.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_72">I thought it proper to acquaint you beforehand, so many persons of quality came, that you might not be surprised therewith.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_73">Which concludes, though by many years' absence since I saw you at Stafford, unknown, Sir, your most humble servant,</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_76">."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_77">'I received this note with less surprise than I believe Mr. Thrifty imagined; for I know the good company too well to feel any palpitations at their approach: but I was in very great concern how I could adjust the ceremonial, and demean myself to all these great men, who perhaps had not seen anything above themselves for these twenty years last past.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_78">I am sure that is the case of Sir Harry.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_79">Besides which, I was sensible that there was a great point in adjusting my behaviour to the simple squire, so as to give him satisfaction, and not disoblige the justice of the quorum.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_80">'The hour of nine was come this morning, and I had no sooner set chairs, by the steward's letter, and fixed my tea-equipage, but I heard a knock at my door, which was opened, but no one entered; after which followed a long silence, which was at last broken by, "Sir, I beg your pardon; I think I know better:" and another voice, "Nay, good Sir Giles——" I looked out from my window, and saw the good company all with their hats off, and arms spread, offering the door to each other.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_81">After many offers, they entered with much solemnity, in the order Mr. Thrifty was so kind as to name them to me.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_82">But they had now got to my chamber-door, and I saw my old friend Sir Harry enter.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_83">I met him with all the respect due to so reverend a vegetable; for you are to know that is my sense of a person who remains idle in</span>
<a id="Page_247" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="247">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_84">the same place for half a century.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_85">I got him with great success into his chair by the fire, without throwing down any of my cups.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_86">The knight-bachelor told me, "he had a great respect for my whole family, and would, with my leave, place himself next to Sir Harry, at whose right hand he had sat at every quarter-sessions these thirty years, unless he was sick."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_87">The steward in the rear whispered the young templar, "That is true to my knowledge."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_88">I had the misfortune, as they stood cheek by jole, to desire the squire to sit down before the justice of the quorum, to the no small satisfaction of the former, and the resentment of the latter.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_89">But I saw my error too late, and got them as soon as I could into their seats.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_90">"Well," said I, "gentlemen, after I have told you how glad I am of this great honour, I am to desire you to drink a dish of tea."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_91">They answered one and all, "that they never drank tea of a morning."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_92">"Not drink tea of a morning?" said I, staring round me.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_93">Upon which the pert jackanapes, Nic Doubt, tipped me the wink, and put out his tongue at his grandfather.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_94">Here followed a profound silence, when the steward, in his boots and whip, proposed, "that we should adjourn to some public house, where everybody might call for what they pleased, and enter upon the business."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_95">We all stood up in an instant, and Sir Harry filed off from the left, very discreetly, countermarching behind the chairs towards the door.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_96">After him Sir Giles, in the same manner.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_97">The simple squire made a sudden start to follow; but the justice of the quorum whipped between upon the stand of the stairs.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_98">A maid, going up with coals, made us halt, and put us into such confusion that we stood all in a heap, without any visible possibility of recovering our order; for the young jackanapes seemed to make a jest of this matter, and had so contrived, by pressing in amongst us, under pretence of making way, that his grandfather was got into the middle, and he knew nobody was of quality to stir a step</span>
<a id="Page_248" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="248">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_99">until Sir Harry moved first.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_100">We were fixed in this perplexity for some time, until we heard a very loud noise in the street; and Sir Harry asking what it was, I, to make them move, said, "it was fire."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_101">Upon this all ran down as fast as they could, without order or ceremony, until we got into the street, where we drew up in very good order, and filed down Sheer Lane; the impertinent templar driving us before him as in a string, and pointing to his acquaintance who passed by.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_102">When we came to Dick's coffee-house we were at our old difficulty, and took up the street upon the same ceremony.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_103">We proceeded through the entry, and were so necessarily kept in order by the situation that we were now got into the coffee-house itself; where, as soon as we arrived, we repeated our civilities to each other: after which we marched up to the high table, which has an ascent to it inclosed in the middle of the room.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_104">The whole house was alarmed at this entry, made up of persons of so much state and rusticity.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_105">Sir Harry called for a mug of ale and "Dyer's Letter."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_106">The boy brought the ale in an instant, but said, "they did not take in the letter."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_107">"No!" says Sir Harry, "then take back your mug; we are like indeed to have good liquor at this house!"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_108">Here the templar tipped me a second wink, and, if I had not looked very grave upon him, I found he was disposed to be very familiar with me.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_109">In short, I observed, after a long pause, that the gentlemen did not care to enter upon business until after their morning draught, for which reason I called for a bottle of mum; and finding that had no effect upon them, I ordered a second, and a third; after which Sir Harry reached over to me, and told me in a low voice, "that place was too public for business; but he would call upon me again to-morrow morning at my own lodgings, and bring some more friends with him."'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_119">I went immediately.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_120">Our neighbour told us, "she had the day before let her second floor to a very genteel youngish man, who told her he kept extraordinary good hours, and was generally at home most part of the morning and evening at study; but that this morning he had for an hour together made this extravagant noise which we then heard."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_121">I went up stairs with my hand upon the hilt of my rapier, and approached this new lodger's door.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_122">I looked in at the key-hole, and there I saw a well-made man look with great attention on a book, and on a sudden jump into the air so high, that his head almost touched the ceiling.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_123">He came down safe on his right foot, and again flew up, alighting on his left; then looked again at his book, and, holding out his leg, put it into such a quivering motion, that I thought that he would have shaken it off.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_124">He used the left after the same manner, when on a sudden, to my great surprise, he stooped himself incredibly low, and turned gently on his toes.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_125">After this circular motion, he continued bent in that humble posture for some time looking on his book.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_126">After this, he recovered himself with a sudden spring, and flew round the room in all the violence and disorder imaginable, until he made a full pause for want of breath.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_127">In this interim my woman asked "what I thought?"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_128">I whispered "that I thought this learned person an enthusiast, who possibly had his education in the Peripatetic way, which was a sect of philosophers, who always studied when walking."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_129">Observing him much out of breath, I thought it the best time to master him if he were disordered, and knocked at his door.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_130">I was surprised to find him</span>

</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_131">open it, and say with great civility and good mien, "that he hoped he had not disturbed us."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_132">I believed him in a lucid interval, and desired "he would please to let me see his book."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_133">He did so, smiling.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_134">I could not make anything of it, and, therefore, asked "in what language it was writ?"</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_135">He said, "it was one he studied with great application; but it was his profession to teach it, and could not communicate his knowledge without a consideration."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_136">I answered that I hoped he would hereafter keep his thoughts to himself, for his meditations this morning had cost me three coffee dishes and a clean pipe.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_137">He seemed concerned at that, and told me "he was a dancing master, and had been reading a dance or two before he went out, which had been written by one who taught at an academy in France."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_138">He observed me at a stand, and informed me, "that now articulate motions as well as sounds were expressed by proper characters; and that there is nothing so common as to communicate a dance by a letter."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_139">I besought him hereafter to meditate in a ground room, for that otherwise it would be impossible for an artist of any other kind to live near him, and that I was sure several of his thoughts this morning would have shaken my spectacles off my nose, had I been myself at study.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_146">'I was very much surprised this evening with a visit from one of the top Toasts of the town, who came privately in a chair, and bolted into my room, while I was reading a chapter of Agrippa upon the occult sciences; but, as she entered with all the air and bloom that nature ever bestowed on woman, I threw down the conjurer and met the charmer.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_233">In answer to this, I told him "he might sometimes extend it to his own destruction.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_234">As you are now," said I, "you are out of the reach of beauty; the shafts of the finest eyes lose their force before they can come at you; you cannot distinguish a Toast from an orange-wench; you can see a whole circle of beauty without any interruption from an impertinent face to discompose you.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_236">In a word, I found his use of a glass was occasioned by no other infirmity but his vanity, and was not so much designed to make him see as to make him be seen and distinguished by others.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_314">The 'Tatler,' still maintaining his court for the examination of frivolities in costume, is engaged in giving judgment on female fashions.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_315">The hooped petticoat is the subject before his worshipful board.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_316">A fair offender has been captured, and stripped of</span>
<a id="Page_261" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="261">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_317">her encumbrances until she is reduced to dimensions which will allow her to enter the house; the petticoat is then hung up to the roof—its ample dimensions covering the entire court like a canopy.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_318">The late wearer had the sense to confess that she 'should be glad to see an example made of it, that she wore it for no other reason but that she had a mind to look as big and burly as other persons of her quality, and that she kept out of it as long as she could and until she began to appear little in the eyes of her acquaintance.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_319">After hearing arguments concerning the encouragement the wearing of these monstrous appendages offered to the woollen manufacturers, to the rope and cord makers, and to the whalebone fisheries of Greenland, the 'Tatler' pronounced his decision that the expense thus entailed on fathers and husbands, and the prejudice to the ladies themselves, 'who could never expect to have any money in the pocket if they laid out so much on the petticoat,' together with the fact that since the introduction of these garments several persons of quality were in the habit of cutting up their cast gowns to strengthen their stiffening, instead of bestowing them as perquisites or in charity, determined him to seize the petticoat as a forfeiture, to be sent as a present to a widow gentlewoman, who had five daughters, to be made into petticoats for each, the remainder to be returned to be cut up into stomachers and caps, facings for waistcoat sleeves, and other garniture.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_320">He thus concludes: 'I consider woman as a beautiful, romantic animal, that may be adorned with furs and feathers, pearls and diamonds, ores and silks.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_321">The lynx shall cast its skin at her feet to make her a tippet; the peacock, parrot, and swan shall pay contributions to her muff; the sea shall be searched for shells, and the rocks for gems; and every part of nature furnish out its share towards the embellishment of a creature that is the most consummate work of it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_322">All this I shall indulge them in; but as for the petticoat I have been speaking of I neither can nor will allow it.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_332">'This paper was allotted for taking into consideration a late request of two indulgent parents, touching the care of a young daughter, whom they design to send to a boarding-school, or keep at home, according to my determination; but I am diverted from that subject by letters which I have received from several ladies, complaining of a certain sect of professed enemies to the repose of the fair sex, called oglers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_333">These are, it seems, gentlemen who look with deep attention on one object at the playhouses, and are ever staring all round them in churches.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_334">It is urged by my correspondents, that they do all that is possible to keep their eyes off these ensnarers; but that, by what power they know not, both their diversions and devotions are interrupted by them in such a manner as that they cannot attend to either, without stealing looks at the persons whose eyes are fixed upon them.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_335">By this means, my petitioners say, they find themselves grow insensibly less offended, and in time enamoured of these their enemies.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_336">What is required of me on this occasion is, that as I love and study to preserve the better part of mankind, the females, I would give them some account of this dangerous way of assault; against which there is so little defence, that it lays ambush for the sight itself, and makes them seeingly, knowingly, willingly, and forcibly go on to their own captivity.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_337">The naturalists tell us that the rattlesnake will fix himself under a tree where he sees a squirrel playing; and when he has once got the exchange of a glance from the pretty wanton, will give it such a sudden stroke on its imagination, that though it may play from bough to bough, and strive to avert its eyes from it for some time, yet it comes nearer and nearer, by little intervals looking another way, until it drops into the jaws of the animal, which it knew gazed at it for no other</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_338">reason but to ruin it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_339">I did not believe this piece of philosophy until the night when I made my observations of the play of eyes at the opera, where I then saw the same thing pass between an ogler and a coquette.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_357">in which he tells him that Jupiter has by him two great vessels, the one filled with blessings, and the other with misfortunes; out of which he mingles a composition for every man that comes into the world.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_358">This passage so exceedingly pleased me, that, as I fell insensibly into my afternoon's slumber, it wrought my imagination into the following dream:—</span>
<a id="Page_264" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="264">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_359">'When Jupiter took into his hands the government of the world, the several parts of nature with the presiding deities did homage to him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_360">One presented him with a mountain of winds, another with a magazine of hail, and a third with a pile of thunderbolts.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_361">The Stars offered up their influences; Ocean gave his trident, Earth her fruits, and the Sun his seasons.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_362">'Among others the Destinies advanced with two great urns, one of which was fixed on the right hand of Jove's throne, and the other on the left.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_363">The first was filled with all the blessings, the second with all the calamities, of human life.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_364">Jupiter, in the beginning of his reign, poured forth plentifully from the right hand; but as mankind, degenerating, became unworthy of his blessings, he broached the other vessel, which filled the earth with pain and poverty, battles and distempers, jealousy and falsehood, intoxicating pleasures and untimely deaths.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_365">He finally, in despair at the depravity of human nature, resolved to recall his gifts and lay them in store until the world should be inhabited by a more deserving race.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_366">'The three sisters of Destiny immediately repaired to the earth in search of the several blessings which had been scattered over it, but found great difficulties in their task.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_367">The first places they resorted to, as the most likely of success, were cities, palaces, and courts; but instead of meeting with what they looked for here, they found nothing but envy, repining, uneasiness, and the like bitter ingredients of the left-hand vessel; whereas, to their great surprise, they discovered content, cheerfulness, health, innocence, and other the most substantial blessings of life, in cottages, shades, and solitudes.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_368">In other places the blessings had been converted into calamities, and misfortunes had become real benefits, while in many cases the two had entered into alliance.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_369">In their perplexity the Destinies were compelled to throw all the blessings and calamities into one vessel, and leave them to Jupiter to use his own discretion in their future distribution.'</span>
