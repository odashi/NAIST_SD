<span id="SENTENCE_0">This celebrated cartoon of the Fraserians appears to place Thackeray's connection with the magazine before 1835; but we have not succeeded in tracing any contribution from his hand earlier than November 1837.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_1">Certainly, the afterwards well-used</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_2">noms de plume</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_3">of Michael Angelo Titmarsh, Fitzboodle, Charles Yellowplush, and Ikey Solomons, are wanting in the earlier volumes.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_4">It is in the number for the month and year referred to that we first find him contributing a paper which is not reprinted in his 'Miscellanies,' and which is interesting as explaining the origin of that assumed character of a footman in which the author of the 'Yellowplush Papers' and 'Jeames's Diary' afterwards took delight.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_5">A little volume had been published in 1837, entitled, 'My Book; or, The Anatomy of Conduct, by John Henry Skelton.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_6">The writer of this absurd book had been a woollendraper in the neighbourhood of Regent Street.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_7">He had become possessed of the fixed idea that he was destined to become the instructor of mankind in the true art of etiquette.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_8">He gave parties to the best company whom he could induce to eat his dinners and assemble</span>
<a id="Page_145" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="145">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_9">at his conversaziones, where his amiable delusion was the frequent subject of the jokes of his friends.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_10">Skelton, however, felt them little.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_11">He spent what fortune he had, and brought himself to a position in which his fashionable acquaintances no longer troubled him with their attentions; but he did not cease to be, in his own estimation, a model of deportment.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_12">He husbanded his small resources, limiting himself to a modest dinner daily at a coffee-house in the neighbourhood of his old home, where his perfectly fitting dress-coat—for in this article he was still enabled to shine—his brown wig and dyed whiskers, his ample white cravat of the style of the Prince Regent's days, and his well-polished boots, were long destined to raise the character of the house on which he bestowed his patronage.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_13">In the days of his prosperity Skelton was understood among his acquaintances to be engaged on a work which should hand down to posterity the true code of etiquette—that body of unwritten law which regulated the society of the time of his favourite monarch.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_14">In the enforced retirement of his less prosperous days, the ex-woollendraper's literary design had time to develop itself, and in the year 1837 'My Book; or, The Anatomy of Conduct, by John Henry Skelton,' was finally given to the world.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_16">It was this little volume which fell in the way of Thackeray, who undertook to review it for 'Fraser's Magazine.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_17">In order to do full justice to the work, nothing seemed more proper than to present the reviewer in the assumed character of a fashionable footman.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_18">The review, therefore, took the form of a letter from Charles Yellowplush, Esq., containing 'Fashionable fax and polite Anny-goats,' dated from 'No. ——, Grosvenor Square (N.B.—Hairy Bell),' and addressed to Oliver Yorke, the well-known pseudonym of the editor of 'Fraser.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_19">To this accident may be attributed those extraordinary efforts of cacography which had their germ in the Cambridge 'Snob,' but which attained their full development in the Miscellanies, the Ballads, the 'Jeames's Diary,' and other</span>
<a id="Page_146" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="146">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_20">short works, and also in some portions of the latest of the author's novels.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_21">The precepts and opinions of 'Skelton,' or 'Skeleton,' as the reviewer insisted on calling the author of the 'Anatomy,' were fully developed and illustrated by Mr. Yellowplush.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_22">The footman who reviewed the 'fashionable world' achieved a decided success.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_23">Charles Yellowplush was requested by the editor to extend his comments upon society and books, and in January 1838 the 'Yellowplush Papers' were commenced, with those vigorous though crude illustrations by the author, which appear at first to have been suggested by the light-spirited style of Maclise's portraits in the same magazine, a manner which afterwards became habitual to him.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_24">The rejected one</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_25">It was in the year 1836 that Thackeray, according to an anecdote related by himself, offered Dickens to undertake the task of illustrating one of his works.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_26">The story was told by the former at an anniversary dinner of the Royal Academy a few years since, Dickens being present on the occasion.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_27">'I can remember,' said Thackeray, 'when Dickens was a very young man, and had commenced delighting the world with some charming humorous works in covers, which were coloured light green, and came out once a month, that this young man wanted an artist to illustrate his writings; and I recollect walking up to his chambers in Furnival's Inn, with two or three drawings in my hand, which, strange to say, he did not find suitable.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_28">But for the unfortunate blight which came over my artistical existence, it would have been my pride and my pleasure to have endeavoured one day to find a place on these walls for one of my performances.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_29">The work referred to was the 'Pickwick Papers,' which was commenced in April of that year, as the result of an agreement with Dickens and Mr. Seymour, the comic artist—the one to write, and the other to illustrate a book which should exhibit the adventures</span>
<a id="Page_147" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="147">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_30">of cockney sportsmen.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_31">As our readers know, the descriptive letterpress, by the author of the 'Sketches by Boz,' soon attracted the attention of the world; while the clever illustrations by Seymour, which had the merit of creating the well-known pictorial characteristics of Mr. Pickwick and his friends, became regarded only as illustrations of the new humorist's immortal work.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_32">Unhappily, only two or three monthly numbers had been completed, when Seymour destroyed himself in a fit of derangement.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_33">A new artist was wanted, and the result was the singular interview between the two men whose names, though representing schools of fiction so widely different, were destined to become constantly associated in the public mind.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_34">Dickens was then acquiring the vast popularity as a writer of fiction which never flagged from that time: the young artist had scarcely attempted literature, and had still before him many years of obscurity.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_35">The slow growth of his fame presents a curious contrast to the career of his fellow-novelist.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_36">Hard as Thackeray subsequently worked in contributing to 'Fraser,' in co-operating with others on daily newspapers, in writing for 'Cruikshank's Comic Almanack,' for the 'Times' and the 'Examiner,' for 'Punch,' and for the 'Westminster' and other Reviews, it could not be said that he was really known to the public till the publication of 'Vanity Fair,' when he had been an active literary man for at least ten years, and had attained the age of thirty-seven.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_37">The 'Yellowplush Papers' in 'Fraser' enjoyed a sort of popularity, and were at least widely quoted in the newspapers; but of their author few inquired.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_38">Neither did the two volumes of the 'Paris Sketch Book,' though presenting many good specimens of his peculiar humour, nor the account of the second funeral of Napoleon, nor even the 'Irish Sketch Book,' do much to make their writer known.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_39">It was his 'Vanity Fair' which, issued in shilling monthly parts, took the world of readers as it were by storm; and an appreciative article from the hand of a friend in the 'Edinburgh Review,' in 1848, for the first time helped to spread the tidings of a new master of fiction among us, destined to make a name second to none, in its own field.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_40">Thackeray was in Paris in March 1836, at the time of the execution of Fieschi and Lacénaire, upon which subject he wrote some remarks in one of his anonymous papers which it is interesting to compare with the more advanced views in favour of the</span>
<a id="Page_148" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="148">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_41">abolition of the punishment of death, which are familiar to the readers of his subsequent article, 'On Going to see a Man Hanged.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_42">He did not witness the execution either of Fieschi or Lacénaire, though he made unsuccessful attempts to be present at both events.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_43">The day for Fieschi's death was purposely kept secret; and he was executed at a remote quarter of the town.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_44">But the scene on the morning when his execution did not take place was never forgotten by the young English artist.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_45">It was carnival time, and the rumour had pretty generally been carried abroad that the culprit was to die on that day.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_46">A friend who accompanied Thackeray came many miles through the mud and dark, in order to be 'in at the death.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_47">They set out before light, floundering through the muddy Champs Elysées, where were many others bent upon the same errand.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_48">They passed by the Concert of Musard, then held in the Rue St. Honoré; and round this, in the wet, a number of coaches were collected: the ball was just up; and a crowd of people, in hideous masquerade, drunk, tired, dirty, dressed in horrible old frippery and daubed with filthy rouge, were trooping out of the place; tipsy women and men, shrieking, jabbering, gesticulating, as Frenchmen will do; parties swaggering, staggering forwards, arm in arm, reeling to and fro across the street, and yelling songs in chorus.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_49">Hundreds of these were bound for the show, and the two friends thought themselves lucky in finding a vehicle to the execution place, at the Barrière d'Enfer.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_50">As they crossed the river, and entered the Rue d'Enfer, crowds of students, black workmen, and more drunken devils from carnival balls, were filling it; and on the grand place there were thousands of these assembled, looking out for Fieschi and his</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_51">cortége</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_52">.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_53">They waited, but no throat-cutting that morning; no august spectacle of satisfied justice; and the eager spectators were obliged to return, disappointed of the expected breakfast of blood.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_55">The other attempt was equally unfortunate.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_56">The same friend accompanied him, but they arrived too late on the ground to be present at the execution of Lacénaire and his co-mate in murder, Avril.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_57">But as they came to the spot (a gloomy round space, within the barrier—three roads led to it—and, outside, they saw the wine-shops and restaurateurs of the barrier looking gay and inviting), they only found, in the midst of it, a little pool of ice, just partially tinged with red.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_58">Two or three idle street boys were dancing and stamping about this pool; and when the Englishmen asked one of them whether the execution had taken place, he began dancing more madly than ever, and shrieked out with a loud fantastical theatrical voice, '</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_59">Venez tous, Messieurs et Dames; voyez ici le sang du monstre Lacénaire et de son compagnon le traître Avril</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_60">;' and straightway all the other gamins screamed out the words in chorus, and took hands and danced round the little puddle.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_61">Thackeray returned to London in March 1836, and resided for a few months in the house of his step-father, Major Henry Carmichael Smyth.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_62">The principal object of his return was to concert with the Major, who was a gentleman of some literary attainments, a project for starting a daily newspaper.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_63">The time was believed to be remarkably opportune for the new journal; the old oppressive newspaper stamp being about to be repealed, and a penny stamp, giving the privilege of a free transmission through the post, to be substituted.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_64">Their project was to form a small</span>
<a id="Page_150" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="150">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_65">joint-stock company, to be called the Metropolitan Newspaper Company, with a capital of 60,000</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_66">l.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_67">, in shares of 10</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_68">l.</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_69">each.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_70">The Major, as chief proprietor, became chairman of the new company; Laman Blanchard was appointed editor, Douglas Jerrold the dramatic critic, and Thackeray the Paris correspondent.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_71">An old and respectable, though decaying journal, entitled the 'Public Ledger,' was purchased by the company; and on September 15, the first day of the reduced stamp duty, the newspaper was started with the title of the 'Constitutional and Public Ledger.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_72">The politics of the paper were ultra-liberal.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_73">Its programme was entire freedom of the press, extension of popular suffrage, vote by ballot, shortening of duration of parliaments, equality of civil rights and religious liberty.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_74">A number of the most eminent of the advanced party, including Mr. Grote, Sir William Molesworth, Mr. Joseph Hume, and Colonel Thompson, publicly advertised their intention to support the new journal, and to promote its circulation.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_75">Thackeray's Paris letters, signed 'T. T.,' commenced on September 24, and were continued at intervals until the spring of the following year.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_76">They present little worth notice.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_77">At that time the chatty correspondent who discourses upon all things save the subject of his letter was a thing unknown.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_78">Bare facts, such as the telegraph-wire now brings us, with here and there a</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_79">soupçon</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_80">of philosophical reflection, were the utmost that the readers of newspapers in those days demanded of the useful individual who kept watch in the capital of civilisation for events of interest.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_81">Generally, however, the letters are characterised by a strong distaste for the Government of July, and by an ardent liberalism which had but slightly cooled down when, at the Oxford election in 1857, he declared himself an uncompromising advocate of vote by ballot.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_82">Writing from Paris on October 8, he says: 'We are luckily too strong to dread much from open hostility, or to be bullied back into Toryism by our neighbours; but if Radicalism be a sin in their eyes, it exists, thank God! not merely across the Alps, but across the Channel.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_83">The new journal, however, was far from prosperous.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_84">After enlarging its size and raising its price from fourpence-halfpenny to fivepence, it gradually declined in circulation.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_85">The last number appeared on July 1, 1837, bearing black borders for the death of the king.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_86">'We can estimate, therefore,' says the dying speech of the 'Constitutional,' 'the feelings of the</span>
<a id="Page_151" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="151">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_87">gentleman who once walked at his own funeral,' and the editor, or perhaps his late Paris correspondent, adds: 'The adverse circumstances have been various.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_88">In the philosophy of ill-luck it may be laid down as a principle that every point of discouragement tends to one common centre of defeat.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_89">When the Fates do concur in one discomfiture their unanimity is wonderful.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_90">So has it happened in the case of the "Constitutional."</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_91">In the first place, a delay of some months, consequent upon the postponement of the newspaper stamp reduction, operated on the minds of many who were originally parties to the enterprise; in the next, the majority of those who remained faithful were wholly inexperienced in the art and mystery of the practical working of an important daily journal; in the third, and consequent upon the other two, there was the want of those abundant means, and of that wise application of resources, without which no efficient organ of the interests of any class of men—to say nothing of the interests of that first and greatest class whose welfare has been our dearest aim and most constant object—can be successfully established.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_92">Then came further misgivings on the part of friends, and the delusive undertakings of friends in disguise.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_93">The venture proved in every way a disastrous one.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_94">Although nominally supported by a joint-stock company, the burden of the undertaking really rested upon the original promoters, of whom Major Smyth was the principal, while his step-son, Thackeray, also lost nearly all that remained of his fortune.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_95">It was shortly after the failure of the 'Constitutional' that Thackeray married in Paris a Miss Shaw, sister of the Captain Shaw, an Indian officer, who was one of the mourners at his funeral, an Irish lady of good family, who bore him two daughters, the elder of whom first gave, during her illustrious father's life-time, indications of inheriting his talents, in the remarkable story of 'Elizabeth,' written by her, and published in the 'Cornhill Magazine.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_96">In 1837 he left Paris with his family, and resided for two years in Great Coram Street, London, when he began to devote himself seriously to literary labour, adding, we believe, occasional work as an illustrator.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_97">We are told that he contributed some papers to the 'Times' during the late Mr. Barnes's editorship—an article on 'Fielding' among them.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_98">He is believed to have been connected with two literary papers of his time—the 'Torch,' edited by Felix</span>
<a id="Page_152" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="152">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_99">Fax, Esq., and the 'Parthenon,' which must not be confounded with a literary journal with the same name recently existing.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_100">The 'Torch,' which was started on August 26, 1837, ran only for six months, and was immediately succeeded by the 'Parthenon,' which had a longer existence.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_101">In neither paper, however, is it possible to trace any sign of that shrewd criticism and that overflowing humour which distinguish the papers in 'Fraser.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_102">For the latter publication he laboured assiduously, and it was at this time that the 'Yellowplush Papers' appeared, with occasional notices of the Exhibitions of Paintings in London.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_103">Among his writings of this period (1837-1840) we also find 'Stubbs's Calendar, or the Fatal Boots,' contributed to his friend Cruikshank's 'Comic Almanack' for 1839, and since included in the 'Miscellanies;' 'Catherine, by Ikey Solomons, jun.,' a long continuous story, founded on the crime of Catherine Hayes, the celebrated murderess of the last century, and intended to ridicule the novels of the school of Jack Sheppard, and illustrated with outline cartoons by the author; 'Cartouche' and 'Poinsonnet,' two stories, and 'Epistles to the Literati.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_104">In 1839 he visited Paris again, at the request of the proprietor of 'Fraser,' in order to write an account of the French Exhibition of Paintings, which appeared in the December number.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_105">On his return he devoted himself to writing the 'Shabby Genteel Story,' which was begun in 'Fraser' for June, and continued in the numbers for July, August, and October, when it stopped unfinished at the ninth chapter.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_106">The story of this strange failure is a mournful one.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_107">While busily engaged in working out this affecting story, a dark shadow descended upon his household, making all the associations of that time painful to him for ever.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_108">The terrible truth, long suspected, that the chosen partner of his good and evil fortunes could never participate in the success for which he had toiled, became confirmed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_109">The mental disease which had attacked his wife rapidly developed itself, until the hopes which had sustained those to whom she was most dear were wholly extinguished.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_110">Thackeray was not one of those who love to parade their domestic sorrows before the world.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_111">No explanation of his omission to complete his story was given to his readers; but, years afterwards, in reprinting it in his 'Miscellanies,' he hinted at the circumstances which had paralyzed his hand, and</span>
<a id="Page_153" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="153">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_112">rendered him incapable of ever resuming the thread of his story, with a touching suggestiveness for those who knew the facts.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_113">The tale was interrupted, he said, 'at a sad period of the writer's own life.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_114">When the republication of the 'Miscellanies' was announced, it was his intention to complete the little story—but the colours were long since dry, the artist's hand had changed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_115">It 'was best,' he said, 'to leave the sketch as it was when first designed seventeen years ago.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_116">The memory of the past is renewed as he looks at it.'</span>
<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@44563@44563-h@44563-h-19.htm.html#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor pginternal" id="FNanchor_9">
<span id="SENTENCE_117">[9]</span>
</a>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_118">It was in 1840 that Thackeray contributed to the 'Westminster' a kindly and appreciative article upon the productions of his friend George Cruikshank, illustrated—an unusual thing for the great organ of the philosophers of the school of Bentham, J. Mill, and Sir W. Molesworth—with numerous specimens of the comic sketches of the subject of the paper.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_119">His defence of Cruikshank from the cavils of those who loved to dwell upon his defects as a draughtsman is full of sound criticism, and his claim for his friend as something far greater, a man endowed with that rarest of all faculties, the power to create, is inspired by a generous enthusiasm which lends a life and spirit to the paper not often found in a critical review.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_120">This long paper, signed with the Greek letter Theta, is little known, but Thackeray frequently referred to it as a labour in which he had felt a peculiar pleasure.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_121">In the summer of 1840 Thackeray collected some of his original sketches inserted in 'Fraser' and other periodicals, English and foreign, and republished them under the title of the 'Paris Sketch Book.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_122">This work is interesting as the first independent publication of the author, but of its contents few things are now remembered.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_123">The dedicatory letter prefixed, however, is peculiarly characteristic of the writer.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_124">It relates to a circumstance which had occurred to him some time previously in Paris.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_125">The old days when money was abundant, and loitering among the pictures of the Paris galleries could be indulged in without remorse, had gone.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_126">The</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_127">res angusta domi</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_128">with which genius has so often been disturbed in its day-dreams began to be familiar to him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_129">The unfortunate failure of the 'Constitutional'—a loss which he, years afterwards, occasionally referred to as a foolish commercial speculation on which he had ventured in his youth—had absorbed the whole of his</span>
<a id="Page_154" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="154">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_130">patrimony.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_131">At such a time a temporary difficulty in meeting a creditor's demand was not uncommon.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_132">On one such occasion, a M. Aretz, a tailor in the Rue Richelieu, who had for some time supplied him with coats and trousers, presented him with a small account for those articles, and was met with a statement from his debtor that an immediate settlement of the bill would be extremely inconvenient to him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_133">To Titmarsh's astonishment the reply of his creditor was, 'Mon Dieu, sir, let not that annoy you.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_134">If you want money, as a gentleman often does in a strange country, I have a thousand-franc note at my house which is quite at your service.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_135">The generous offer was accepted.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_136">The coin which, in proof of the tailor's esteem for his customer, was advanced without any interest, was duly repaid together with the account; but the circumstance could not be forgotten.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_137">The person obliged felt how becoming it was to acknowledge and praise virtue, as he slily said, wherever he might find it, and to point it out for the admiration and example of his fellow-men.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_138">Accordingly, he determined to dedicate his first book to the generous tailor, giving at full length his name and address.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_139">In the dedicatory letter, he accordingly alludes to this anecdote, adding—</span>
</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<span id="SENTENCE_147">A second edition of the 'Paris Sketch Book' was announced by the publisher, Macrone—the same publisher who had a few years before given to the world the 'Sketches by Boz,' the first of Dickens' publications; but the second edition was probably only one of those conventional fictions with which the spirits of young authors are sustained.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_148">Though containing many flashes of the</span>
<a id="Page_155" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="155">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_149">Titmarsh humour, many eloquent passages, and much interesting reading of a light kind, the public took but a passing interest in it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_150">Years after, in quoting its title, the author good-humouredly remarked, in a parenthesis, that some copies, he believed, might still be found unsold at the publisher's; but the book was forgotten and most of its contents were rejected by the writer when preparing his selected miscellanies for the press.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_151">A similar couple of volumes, published by Cunningham in 1841, under the title of 'Comic Tales and Sketches, edited and illustrated by Mr. Michael Angelo Titmarsh,' and an independent republication, also in two volumes, of the 'Yellowplush Papers,' from 'Fraser,' were somewhat more successful.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_152">The former contained 'Major Gahagan' and the 'Bedford-row Conspiracy,' reprinted from the 'New Monthly;' 'Stubbs's Calendar, or the Fatal Boots,' from Cruikshank's</span>
<a id="Page_156" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="156">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_153">'Comic Almanack;' some amusing criticisms on the 'Sea Captain,' and 'Lady Charlotte Bury's Diary,' and other papers from 'Fraser.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_154">The illustrations to the volumes were tinted etchings of a somewhat more careful character than those unfinished artistic drolleries in which he generally indulged.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_155">A brace of portraits of Dr. Lardner and Bulwer may be reckoned in the great humourist's happiest caricature vein.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_156">In December 1840 he again visited Paris, and remained there until the summer of the following year.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_157">He was in that city on the memorable occasion of the second funeral of Napoleon, or the ceremony of conveying the remains of that great warrior, of whom, as a child, he had obtained a living glimpse, to their last resting-place at the Hôtel des Invalides.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_158">An account of that ceremony, in the form of a letter to Miss Smith, was published by Macrone.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_159">It was a small square pamphlet, chiefly memorable now as containing at the end his remarkable poem of the 'Chronicle of the Drum.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_160">About this time he advertised, as preparing for immediate publication, a book entitled 'Dinner Reminiscences, or the Young Gourmandiser's Guide at Paris, by Mr. M. A. Titmarsh.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_161">It was to be issued by Hugh Cunningham, the publisher, of St. Martin's Place, Trafalgar Square, but we believe was never published.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_162">It was in the September number of 'Fraser,' for 1841, that he commenced his story of the 'History of Samuel Titmarsh, and the Great Hoggarty Diamond,' which, though it failed to achieve an extraordinary popularity, first convinced that select few who judge for themselves in matters of literature and art, of the great power and promise of the unknown 'Titmarsh.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_163">Carlyle, in his 'Life of John Sterling,' quotes the following remarkable passage from a letter of the latter to his mother, written at this period:—'I have seen no new books, but am reading your last.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_164">I got hold of the two first numbers of the "Hoggarty Diamond," and read them with extreme delight.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_165">What is there better in Fielding or Goldsmith?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_166">The man is a true genius, and with quiet and comfort might produce masterpieces that would last as long as any we have, and delight millions of unborn readers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_167">There is more truth and nature in one of these papers than in all ——'s novels put together.' 'Thackeray (adds Carlyle), always a close friend of the Sterling House, will observe that this is dated 1841, not 1851, and will have his own reflections on the matter.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_168">The 'Hoggarty Diamond'</span>
<a id="Page_157" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="157">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_169">was continued in the numbers for October and November, and completed in December 1841.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_170">In the number for June of the following year, 'Fitzboodle's Confessions' were commenced, and were continued at intervals down to the end of 1843.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_171">The 'Irish Sketch Book,' in two volumes, detailing an Irish tour, was also published in the latter year.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_172">The 'Sketch Book' did not at the time attract much attention.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_173">The 'Luck of Barry Lyndon,' by many considered the most original of his writings, was begun and finished at No. 88, St. James Street, previously known as the Conservative Club, where at this time he occupied chambers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_174">The first part appeared in 'Fraser' for January 1844, and was continued regularly every month, till its completion in the December number.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_175">He was engaged a short time before this as assistant editor of the 'Examiner' newspaper, to which journal he contributed numerous articles; and among his papers in 'Fraser' and other magazines of the same period, we find, 'Memorials of Gourmandising;' 'Pictorial Rhapsodies on the Exhibitions of Paintings;' 'Bluebeard's Ghost;' a satirical article on Grant's 'Paris and the Parisians;' a 'Review of a Box of Novels' (already quoted from); 'Little Travels and Roadside Sketches' (chiefly in Belgium); 'The</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_177">, by Lancelot Wagstaff'—a comic story, with a sequel entitled 'Arabella, or the Moral of the</span>
<i>
<span id="SENTENCE_178">Partie Fine</span>
</i>
<span id="SENTENCE_179">;' 'Carmen Lilliense;' 'Picture Gossip;' more comic sketches, with the titles of 'The Chest of Cigars, by Lancelot Wagstaff;' 'Bob Robinson's First Love;' and 'Barmecide Banquets,' and an admirable satirical review entitled 'A Gossip about Christmas Books.'</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_180">The 'Carmen Lilliense' will be well remembered by the readers of the 'Miscellanies,' published in 1857, in which it was included.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_181">Thackeray was in the north of France and in Belgium about the period when it is dated (2nd September, 1843); and the ballad describes a real accident which befell him, though doubtless somewhat heightened in effect.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_182">It tells how, leaving Paris with only twenty pounds in his pocket, for a trip in Belgium, he arrived at Antwerp, where, feeling for his purse, he found it had vanished with the entire amount of his little treasure.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_183">Some rascal on the road had picked his pocket, and nothing was left but to borrow ten guineas of a friend whom he met, and to write a note to England addressed to 'Grandmamma,' for whom we may probably read some other member of the Titmarsh family.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_184">The</span>
<a id="Page_158" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="158">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_185">ten guineas, however, were soon gone, and the sensitive Titmarsh found himself in a position of great delicacy.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_186">What was to be done?</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_187">'To stealing,' says the ballad, 'he could never come.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_188">To pawn his watch he felt himself 'too genteel;' besides, he had left his watch at home, which at once put an end to any debates on this point.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_189">There was nothing to do but to wait for the remittance, and beguile the time with a poetical description of his woes.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_190">The guests around him ask for their bills.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_191">Titmarsh is in agonies.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_192">The landlord regards him as a 'Lord Anglais,' serves him with the best of meat and drink, and is proud of his patronage.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_193">A sense of being a kind of impostor weighs upon him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_194">The landlord's eye became painful to look at.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_195">Opposite is a dismal building—the prison-house of Lille, where, by a summary process, familiar to</span>
<a id="Page_159" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="159">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_196">French law, foreigners who run in debt without the means of paying may be lodged.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_197">He is almost tempted to go into the old Flemish church and invoke the saints there after the fashion of the country.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_198">One of their pictures on the walls becomes, in his imagination, like the picture of 'Grandmamma,' with a smile upon its countenance.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_199">Delightful dream! and one of good omen.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_200">He returns to his hotel, and there to his relief finds the long-expected letter, in the well-known hand, addressed to 'Mr. M. A. Titmarsh, Lille.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_201">He obtains the means of redeeming his credit, bids farewell to his host without any exposure, takes the diligence, and is restored to his home that evening.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_202">Such are the humorous exaggerations with which he depicts his temporary troubles at Lille, in the shape of a ballad, originally intended, we believe, for the amusement of his family, but finally inserted in 'Fraser.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_204">It was in July 1844 that Thackeray started on a tour in the East—the result of a hasty invitation, and of a present of a free pass from a friend connected with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_205">His sudden departure, upon less than thirty-six hours' notice, is pleasantly detailed in the preface to his book, published at Christmas, 1845, with the title of 'Notes of a Journey from Cornhill to Grand Cairo by way of Lisbon, Athens, Constantinople, and Jerusalem: performed in the steamers of the Peninsular and Oriental Company.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_208">The book was illustrated with coloured drawings by the author, treating, in a not exaggerated vein of fun, the peculiarities of the daily life of the East.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_209">The little book was well received, and in the reviews of it there is evidence of the growing interest of the public in the writer.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_210">For the first time it presented him to his readers in his true name, for though the 'Titmarsh' fiction is preserved on the title-page, the prefatory matter is signed 'W. M. Thackeray.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_211">'"Who is Titmarsh?" says one of his critics at this time.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_213">"Who is Michael Angelo Titmarsh?"</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_221">The foundation in 1841 of a weekly periodical, serving as a vehicle for the circulation of the lighter papers of humourists, had unquestionably an important influence in the development of his talents and fame.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_222">From an early date he was connected with 'Punch,' at first as the 'Fat Contributor,' and soon after as the author of 'Jeames's Diary' and the 'Snob Papers.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_223">If satire could do aught to check the pride of the vulgar upstart, or shame social hypocrisy into truth and simplicity, these writings would accomplish the task.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_224">In fact, Thackeray's name was now becoming known, and people began to distinguish and enquire for his contributions; his illustrations in 'Punch' being as funny as his articles were.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_225">The series called 'Jeames's Diary' caused great amusement and no little flutter in high polite circles, for the deposition from the throne of railwaydom of the famous original of 'Jeames de la Pluche' had hardly then begun, though it was probably accelerated by the universal titters of recognition which welcomed the weekly accounts of the changing fortunes of 'Jeames.'</span>

</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_229">The great work, however, which was to stamp the name of Thackeray for ever in the minds of English readers was yet to come.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_230">Hitherto all his writings had been brief and desultory, but in contributing to magazines his style had gradually matured itself.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_231">That ease of expression, and that repose which seems so full of power, were never more exemplified than in some of his latest essays in 'Fraser,' before book writing had absorbed all his time.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_232">His articles on Sir E. B. Lytton's 'Memoir of Laman Blanchard,' his paper on 'Illustrated Children's Books,' his satirical proposal to Mons.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_233">Alexandre Dumas for a continuation of 'Ivanhoe,' all contributed to 'Fraser' in 1846, and his article—we believe the last which he wrote for that periodical—entitled 'A Grumble about Christmas Books,' published in January 1847, are equal to anything in his later works.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_234">The first-mentioned of these papers, indeed—the remonstrance with Laman Blanchard's biographer—is unsurpassed for the eloquence of its defence of the calling of men of letters, and for the tenderness and manly simplicity with which it touches on the history of the unfortunate subject of the memoir.</span>
<a id="Page_162" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="162">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_235">'Mrs. Perkins's Ball,' a Christmas book, was published in December 1846.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_236">But its author had long been preparing for a more serious undertaking.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_237">Some time before, he had sketched some chapters entitled 'Pencil Sketches of English Society,' which he had offered to Colburn for insertion in the 'New Monthly Magazine.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_238">It formed a portion of a continuous story, of a length not yet determined, and was rejected by Colburn after consideration.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_239">The papers which Thackeray had previously contributed to the 'New Monthly' were chiefly slight comic stories—perhaps the least favourable specimens of his powers.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_240">They were, indeed, not superior to the common run of magazine papers, and were certainly not equal to his contributions to 'Fraser.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_241">In fact, as a contributor to the 'New Monthly' he had achieved no remarkable success, and his papers appear to have been little in demand there.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_242">Whether the manuscript had been offered to 'Fraser'—the magazine in which 'Titmarsh' had secured popularity, and where he was certainly more at home—we cannot say.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_243">Happily, the author of 'Pencil Sketches of English Society,' though suspending his projected work, did not abandon it.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_244">He saw in its opening chapters—certainly not the best portions of the story when completed—the foundations of a work which was to secure him at last a fame among contemporary writers in his own proper name.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_245">The success of Dickens's shilling monthly parts suggested to him to make it the commencement of a substantive work of fiction, to be published month by month, with illustrations by the author.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_246">The work grew up by degrees, and finally took shape under the better title of 'Vanity Fair.'</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_247">It was during this time, the latter part of 1846, that he removed to his house at No. 13 Young Street, Kensington, a favourite locality with him, in which house he resided for some years.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_248">He also at this time occupied chambers at No. 10 Crown-office Row, Temple, the comfortable retirement which, 'up four pair of stairs,' with its grand view, when the sun was shining, of the chimney-pots over the way, he has himself described.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_249">His friend Tom Taylor, the well-known dramatist and biographer, had chambers in the same house; and we believe, on the demolition of No. 10 Crown-office Row, wrote a poem, published in the pages of 'Punch,' in which, if we remember rightly, mention is made of the fact of Thackeray's having resided there.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_261">Pending this decision, the sanction of the Benchers to interment within the precincts of the Temple Church had been asked and cheerfully accorded; and when the Kensal Green Cemetery was finally decided upon, the Benchers were requested to permit the erection of a memorial slab in their church.</span>

<p>
<span id="SENTENCE_271">It is generally acknowledged that to the thoughtful and appreciative article in the 'Edinburgh Review' of January 1848, which dealt with the first eleven numbers of the work only, is due the merit of authoritatively calling attention to the great power it displayed.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_272">The writer was evidently one who knew Thackeray well; for he gives a sketch of his life, and mentions having met him some years before, painting in the Louvre in Paris.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_273">'In forming,' says this judicious critic, 'our general estimate of this writer, we wish to be understood as referring principally, if not exclusively, to "Vanity Fair" (a novel in monthly parts), which, though still unfinished, is immeasurably superior, in our opinion, to every other known production of his pen.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_274">The great charm of this work is its entire freedom from mannerism and affectation both in style and sentiment—confiding frankness with which the reader is addressed—the thoroughbred carelessness with which the author permits the thoughts and feelings suggested by the situations to flow in their natural channel, as if conscious that nothing mean or unworthy, nothing requiring to be shaded, gilded, or dressed up in company attire, could fall from him.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_275">In a word, the book is the work of a gentleman, which is one great merit, and not the work of a fine (or would-be fine) gentleman, which is another.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_276">Then, again, he never exhausts, elaborates, or insists too much upon anything; he drops his finest remarks and happiest illustrations as Buckingham dropped his pearls, and leaves them to be picked up and appreciated as chance may bring a discriminating observer to the spot.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_277">His effects are uniformly the effects of sound, wholesome, legitimate art; and we need hardly</span>
<a id="Page_165" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="165">
</a>
<span id="SENTENCE_278">add, that we are never harrowed up with physical horrors of the Eugène Sue school in his writings, or that there are no melodramatic villains to be found in them.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_279">One touch of nature makes the whole world kin, and here are touches of nature by the dozen.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_280">His pathos (though not so deep as Dickens's) is exquisite; the more so, perhaps, because he seems to struggle against it, and to be half ashamed of being caught in the melting mood; but the attempt to be caustic, satirical, ironical, or philosophical, on such occasions, is uniformly vain; and again and again have we found reason to admire how an originally fine and kind nature remains essentially free from worldliness, and, in the highest pride of intellect, pays homage to the heart.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_288">for life, the author answered with that fervour as well as heartiness of frankness which distinguished him: 'Well, when I wrote the sentence, I slapped my fist on the table, and said, "That is a touch of genius!"' 'Vanity Fair' soon rose rapidly in public favour, and a new work from the pen of its author was eagerly looked for.</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_290">During the time of publication of 'Vanity Fair' he had found time to write and publish the little Christmas book entitled 'Our Street,' which appeared in December 1847, and reached a second edition soon after Christmas.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_291">'Vanity Fair' was followed in 1849 by another long work of fiction, entitled the 'History of Pendennis; his Fortunes and Misfortunes, his Friends and his Greatest Enemy; with Illustrations by the Author;' which was completed in two volumes.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_292">In this year, too, he published 'Dr. Birch' and 'Rebecca and Rowena.'</span>

<span id="SENTENCE_298">If he had seen, he frankly avowed that he had seen the attack, and did not scruple to reply if he had an opportunity, and the influence of the journal or reviewer made it worth while.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_299">With the 'Times' he had had very early a bout of this kind.</span>
<span id="SENTENCE_300">When the little account of the funeral of Napoleon in 1840 was published, the 'Times,' as he said, rated him, and talked in 'its own great roaring way about the flippancy and conceit of Titmarsh,' to which he had replied by a sharp paragraph or two.</span>
